  <p>“I’ll be in your care today.”</p>

  <p>“Dust, do you understand that money will be gone if you use it?”</p>

  <p>Even though I gave her a jovial greeting, Loli Succubus asked me such a foolish question.</p>

  <p>Normally I would shoot back with a retort of my own, but I can’t afford to do that right now.</p>

  <p>“Don’t say that. If you just sit on your money, the economy won’t turn, you know? My money make their rounds around the town and cause the wheels of prosperity to turn.”</p>

  <p>“Whatever meagre funds you have barely holds a candle to even the lowliest of minor nobles, you know?”</p>

  <p>“You really aren’t cute at all…”</p>

  <p>“I don’t really want you to find me cute anyway. But Vanir-sama is a different matter.”</p>

  <p>She must have been imagining a scene of Sir Vanir praising her, as a blush crept up her face and she fidgeted excitedly.</p>

  <p>We are in the succubus shop, so she was wearing her lingering like clothing. Normally, moving around like that while wearing such revealing clothes is dangerous in a lot of ways, but with her petite figure, it doesn’t do anything for me at all.</p>

  <p>All the other succubi have amazing bodies, so why is she the only one who doesn’t seem to grow at all?</p>

  <p>“Well, everyone values different things.”</p>

  <p>“The way you look at me when you say that kind of pisses me off.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, you shouldn’t use that kind of tone when talking to a regular customer. Sorry, Dust.”</p>

  <p>The succubus in charge apologized on behalf of Loli Succubus.</p>

  <p>She’s Loli Succubus’s superior in all respects, and seeing those peaks wobble when she gives me a bow makes me forgive absolutely everything.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry about it. More importantly, I’ll be in your care for today’s work.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, we’ll be counting on you as a handyman and bouncer.”</p>

  <p>The succubus in charge bowed, Loli Succubus reluctantly followed.</p>

  <p>Due to certain events, I was barred from working at the Adventurer’s Guild for several days, so I had to make do with a part time job here for now.</p>

  <p>“Right then, I’ll leave explaining the details to you.”</p>

  <p>“Understood… Dust-san, please try your best to avoid doing anything unnecessary.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, I won’t do anything, so don’t worry.”</p>

  <p>“Umm, please actually do some work…”</p>

  <p>I’ve been attached to Loli Succubus for the day, so I think I’ll try and avoid causing any incidents.</p>

  <p>She brought me by the doors and told me to please stand guard there, so I leaned against the wall and looked out into the store.</p>

  <p>Just seeing the succubi walk around in such revealing clothes made me want to earn some money as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>It’s still early, so there aren’t many customers yet, but soon enough this place will be filled with numerous burly adventurers.</p>

  <p>Almost as if on cue, a pair of adventurers that I’ve run into occasionally came strolling into the store.</p>

  <p>“What dream are you going to get today? Being lectured by an older girl is great, but pampering someone younger sounds nice too.”</p>

  <p>“I’m going for a love with someone of a much higher social status than me. It’s a dream after all, so I might as well go for a situation that is impossible in reality.”</p>

  <p>“Welcome, dear customers.”</p>

  <p>I’m an employee today, so I welcomed them as instructed, but they instead stared at my face.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing, Dust? It’s kinda creepy.”</p>

  <p>“If you are ordering a dream, then go home and sleep already. What are you doing hiding behind the door for?”</p>

  <p>It seems like they didn’t even consider that I’m working here. But, well, I suppose that’s to be expected.</p>

  <p>“I’m working here today. If you are looking for a dream, I have a few suggestions that you might appreciate.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t need it! Nobody wants to know what your tastes are!”</p>

  <p>“What!? I’m genuinely offering to help you here, and this is how you treat me!?”</p>

  <p>Just when I’m considering teaching this cheeky bastard a lesson, someone smacked me on the head.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing!?”</p>

  <p>I turned around, and standing right there was Loli Succubus with a serving tray in hand.</p>

  <p>“Please don’t pick a fight with the customers! I apologize for any trouble this good-for-nothing has caused.”</p>

  <p>“Ahh, it’s fine. Lolisa-chan, you must have your hands full dealing with this guy every day.”</p>

  <p>“You two have been spending a lot of time together recently. Don’t tell me, you two are…”</p>

  <p>The two of them glanced between the two of us before looking at each other.</p>

  <p>“Wait, that is not the-”</p>

  <p>“That is impossible! There’s no way I could be with such a debt ridden, scummy and worthless person! In the first place, I’m a succubus! The only person I have eyes for is Vanir-sama!”</p>

  <p>T-This girl. There’s no need to deny it so strongly that you’re red in the face.</p>

  <p>“You got it. I have no interest in you either.”</p>

  <p>“The way you’re saying it like you don’t even see me as a woman kind of pisses me off.”</p>

  <p>“You really are a troublesome girl, you know that?”</p>

  <p>While we were arguing, the two adventurers went to take a seat and started filling out their forms.</p>

  <p>Loli Succubus seemed to have calmed down after saying what she wanted to say, and went back to her work.</p>

  <p>I had nothing else to do, so I returned to my job of standing at the door.</p>

  <p>“Good work today. I’ll be back tomorrow.”</p>

  <p>After work ended and I received my pay, I said that.</p>

  <p>“Please don’t come back any more!” x3</p>

  <p>But they instantly rejected me.</p>

  <p>“Dust-san, you keep peeking at the forms the customers fill out and saying comments like ’Ooh, you have some good tastes.‘ and ’Isn’t this level of play a little too high?’, so all the customers keep getting scared away!”</p>
