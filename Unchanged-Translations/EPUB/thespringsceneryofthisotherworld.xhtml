  <hr/>

  <p>Just shortly after noon, the light of the sun shines in gently through the window.</p>

  <p>I was enjoying a short nap by the window after lunch, before a sudden loud noise blew any trace of the previously comfortable atmosphere away.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Let’s go flowerwatching! The cherry blossoms are really beautiful today!”</p>

  <p>Hearing Aqua in such high spirits gave me a bad feeling, so I continued pretending to sleep.</p>

  <p>“… Are you sleeping? Hey, Kazuma, you’re actually awake, aren’t you?”</p>

  <p>Just as Aqua was shaking my body,</p>

  <p>“Aqua, it’s too cruel to force a sleeping man awake. Let’s just enjoy the flower viewing with the three of us.”</p>

  <p>“True… Kazuma must be worn out by his constant adventures. Let’s just enjoy the flowers without him.”</p>

  <p>Megumin and Darkness said, convincing Aqua to give up.</p>

  <p>“It would’ve been merrier the more people we had with us, but… Oh well. We even managed to procure high quality snacks to go with the wine too.”</p>

  <p>… High quality snacks.</p>

  <p>No, no, no, don’t fall for it. Nothing good comes out of getting involved with the plants of this world.</p>

  <p>Even if there is a cherry blossom in this world, it’d be the kind that’d spit sap in your eyes before slicing you to pieces with their sharp vines or something.</p>

  <p>Then Aqua would cry, Darkness would clutch her head, Megumin would blow it and the entire area up and I’ll have to clean up after them.</p>

  <p>I removed all thoughts of the high quality snacks from my mind and remained motionless…</p>

  <p>“After all, the cherry blossom spirits always appear completely nude. It’d be too much excitement for Kazuma, so…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, what are you three doing!? Hurry up and grab your stuff! You didn’t forget to bring the wine? Alright, let’s hurry up and go!”</p>

  <p>When I shot up from my bed and started shouting instructions, the three of them looked at me like they were looking at walking garbage—</p>

  <p>—Cherry blossoms.</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san! Please save me!”</p>

  <p>That’s a flower that heralds the coming of spring, one that all Japanese love.</p>

  <p>“Kuzuma, quick, scatter the wine on the ground! The cherry blossom spirits will return to the ground to drink once you do!”</p>

  <p>—Cherry blossoms.</p>

  <p>“A Crimson Demon like me is not going to lose to a mere plant! Buy me some time! I’ll use Explosion to blow them all away!!”</p>

  <p>A flower that only blooms for a short time, and thus captures the adoration of the public.</p>

  <p>“Don’t look down on us Japanese! Even if I die I will definitely catch a clear view of you cherry blossoms spirits!”</p>

  <p>I stopped Darkness who was just about to start pouring wine.</p>

  <p>“Come up here and face me!!!”</p>

  <p>Yelling, I charged straight into the cloud of flower petals—</p>

  <p>In the end, Aqua cried, Darkness clutched her head, Megumin used Explosion and blew up the entire area, and I had to pay for the destruction of one cherry blossom tree.</p>
