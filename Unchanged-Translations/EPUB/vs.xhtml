  <p>Occurrence: After Volume 8</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>Under the gaze of several children, Megumin flipped her mantle and announced herself:</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Megumin! The number one magician of Axel, and the one who controls explosion magic!”</p>

  <p>Standing directly across from Megumin was…</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Yunyun! The number one magician of the Crimson Magic clan…Kyaa-! Wait-, I’m still introducing myself! Stop, stop!!”</p>

  <p>-Yunyun, who began to scream after getting preemptively attacked during her introduction.</p>

  <p>In the early morning, at the park in the town of Axel-</p>

  <p>Two Crimson Magic clansmen were rolling across the floor.</p>

  <p>And I was looking directly at the two of them..</p>

  <p>“…Um, for now, can we just say that it’s Megumin’s win?”</p>

  <p>“I won’t accept that! The rule that you should wait until the opponent has finished introducing themselves… Ah, wait Megumin! I understand, I understand! It’s my loss it’s my loss! So stop pulling on my hair!!”</p>

  <p>As Megumin continued to lunge at her, Yunyun admitted her defeat in tears.</p>

  <p>-The way this all started, was when Yunyun - who had come to our mansion to sleepover - nonchalantly said something with no ill intentions whatsoever.</p>

  <p>“It’s true that I have more losses, but that’s because Megumin was the one to decide the contents of every match. Also, Megumin and I have never really had a legitimate match right?”</p>

  <p>I absentmindedly listened to Megumin and Yunyun talk about their past. They talked about a bunch of things…</p>

  <p>Like who was the stronger of the two, and stuff like that…</p>

  <p>“-While I did hand the title of ’number one magician in the Crimson Magic clan’ to you, I’m just annoyed that you can announce that so pridefully!”</p>

  <p>“That’s not a valid reason to break the rules! Geez I understand already ok!? The first round is my loss ok!?”</p>

  <p>Yunyun was pushed down and mounted by Megumin. No matter how I looked at it, I could not see any single trace of a mature argument.</p>

  <p>“Since Megumin won the first round… The next match will be chosen by Yunyun right?”</p>

  <p>As someone who had been slowly solicited into being an observer, I wanted this embarrassing competition to end as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Due to the flashy introductions akin to the Crimson Magic clan, we’ve recently become the center of attention of the children in town.</p>

  <p>Amongst the children, there were some that have began imitating the poses of these Crimson Magic clansmen.</p>

  <p>Under the collective gaze of these children, tears could be faintly seen in Yunyun’s eyes, and she had shamefully swept the dirt of her clothes, and picked up her purse that had fallen during her quarrel with Megumin.</p>

  <p>“Then the next match will be… this board game!”</p>

  <p>It was a game that I was familiar with; the chess-like game that Megumin was good at.</p>

  <p>“My how unsightly. Yunyun, since you don’t have any friends, you decided to spend the past year training in this game? I’m sure your skill in this game is comparable to a grandmaster already.”</p>

  <p>“You don’t have to voice your contempt on how I haven’t made any friends in the past year! Anyway, are you trying to refuse this challenge knowing that you’ll lose? A true Crimson Magic clansman would take any challenge head-on right?”</p>

  <p>“You little…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun showed fearless smile towards Megumin, who growled and grit her teeth, and began to arrange the board pieces.</p>

  <p>-Yunyun won, and so, the second round ended in a superbly plain fashion.</p>

  <p>“With this the score is tied at one to one! Now then, what will our last match be? Will it be a magic showdown like true Crimson Magic clansmen? Ah, but if we’re doing that then let’s see who can defeat more monsters…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun, who had beat Megumin in a convincing manner in the second round, seemed uncharacteristically excited. Though, it was probably because she rarely had any company.</p>

  <p>Then, Megumin turned to face me.</p>

  <p>“Why don’t we have our observer, Kazuma, choose the last match? I wouldn’t complain about his choice, well then, let’s finish this!”</p>

  <p>“Kazuma-san will? Well, I’m fine with that…”</p>

  <p>Even though they said that, I wanted to hurry up and go home already…</p>

  <p>“Well since this is troublesome, let just settle this with rock-paper-”</p>

  <p>“What do take the holy showdown between Crimson Magic clansmen for-!?”</p>

  <p>“Please choose a little more seriously!”</p>

  <p>Even though I had made the correct decision, I was berated by the two of them.</p>

  <p>Geez these people… why don’t I just say that we’ll have a sexy showdown where whoever can successfully seduce me first wins?</p>

  <p>As I was deciding whether I should say something that borderlines on sexual harassment-</p>

  <p>A group of two police officers who appeared to be on patrol arrived at the park.</p>

  <p>The children said something to the police officers, and the police officers quickly turned to look in our direction.</p>

  <p>…I can’t but feel an ill premonition.</p>

  <p>“Alright then, let’s decide the topic of this match.”</p>

  <p>The officers probably had an ill premonition as well, and never removed their gazes from Megumin and Yunyun.</p>

  <p>“What kind of match are we having? By the way, I was thinking that I wouldn’t mind staying in jail for today…”</p>

  <p>“A-Actually, I wouldn’t mind having this match some other day, and…”</p>

  <p>Noticing the two getting cold feet, the police officers quickly closed the distance and asked:</p>

  <p>“You guys, can I have a moment? I got a report from the neighbours that said that the people who were teaching the children weird games were here…”</p>

  <p>“The winner of the match will be whoever can stay here longer! I’m going home first so-!”</p>

  <p>“I’ll take this challenge head on! Kuh-! As expected of Yunyun, to think that you would defeat me so easily-!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, I didn’t say that I accepted this, so I haven’t won yet! So why is Megumin running away with such regret!? Ah-! Um-, Patrol-san please don’t misunderstand! I wasn’t doing anything bad so…-!”</p>

  <p>-Yunyun won.</p>
