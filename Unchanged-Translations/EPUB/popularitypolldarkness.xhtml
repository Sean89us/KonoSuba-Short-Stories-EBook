  <h1>Popularity Poll Short Story 3: Darkness Short Story - Amical Concern</h1>

  <p>[This is the third short story that was released on the sneaker bunko site for the top three winners of the popularity contest.]</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>On that day.</p>

  <p>When I came to, the first thing I saw was Darkness creeping into my room for a night raid.</p>

  <p>“… This is my first time, so I’d really wish you’d pay attention to the mood when you do stuff like this.”</p>

  <p>“I-Idiot, what are you saying!? Don’t say such misleading things the first thing in the morning! What were you going to do if someone saw us and got the wrong impression!?”</p>

  <p>To be specific, it’s not actually night right now, so calling it a night raid is perhaps not strictly accurate.</p>

  <p>Darkness quickly hastened to shut me up, but it’s already too late…</p>

  <p>“A-Awawawawawa! Darkness is leaning over Kazuma first thing in the morning!”</p>

  <p>“Aqua!? Wait, that’s not it! I have something I need to talk to Kazuma about and wanted to wake him…!”</p>

  <p>Aqua said while peeking in through the gap in the door, and Darkness hastily shouted back while covering me with my blanket.</p>

  <p>“— In other words, after you tripped over me while waiting for a good time to wake me up, I woke up just as you were trying to get off me without waking me?”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yes, that’s exactly it! I thought it was uncharacteristically clumsy of me too…!”</p>

  <p>Darkness seemed to be on the verge of tears as I finally understood what happened after much explanation.</p>

  <p>“So that’s when you thought ’Since Kazuma-san is already awake…‘ and decide to go through with it, right?”</p>

  <p>“Aqua, don’t butt in! Who would do something that stupid!? Ah, dammit…!”</p>

  <p>Darkness took a moment to compose herself after receiving our constant teasing and, with a freshly serious expression on her face, said.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, please lend me your aid! Chris has been acting really strange as of late!”</p>

  <p>—While watching over her from the shadows, Darkness whispered to Aqua and me.</p>

  <p>“… Chris has been hanging out with some unsavoury characters around here recently. I wanted to ask her what she was up to myself, but, err…”</p>

  <p>Darkness trailed off, glancing between Aqua and me.</p>

  <p>“But… what? I won’t get it if you don’t say it.”</p>

  <p>When I urged her to continue, Darkness reluctantly turned towards me.</p>

  <p>“… Well, thinking about it, I too hang out with some unsavoury characters…”</p>

  <p>“Oh, oh, Darkness-san, you sure said some interesting things, haven’t you!”</p>

  <p>“Kazuma-san, hold her down! I’m going to put her hair into pigtails and parade her around the adventurer’s guild!”</p>

  <p>As the two unsavoury characters closed in on Darkness, she motioned for us to be quiet between bouts of near silent pleading.</p>

  <p>“Seriously, so this is why you brought me along… Chris has the Enemy Detection skill, so she’ll easily figure out if anyone else is following her.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, exactly. With you here, we can follow her much more closely with your Lurk skill. Normally, there’s no way I could’ve tailed her from this close… Ah, that’s him, Kazuma! Anyone would say that man looks to be up to no good… Ah!? He brought out a suspicious bag!”</p>

  <p>Following Darkness’s pointing, I saw Chris talking to a man wearing a thick leather jacket.</p>

  <p>The muscle bound man with deep scars on his cheeks had a bag filled with white powder in his hands—</p>

  <p>“That’s the guy who runs the cake shop. He apparently used to be an adventurer, but his dream was always to open a cake shop. It seems like he’s passing Chris good flour and sugar at her request.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Darkness, get a hold of yourself! Shouldn’t you be happy that we were worried for nothing!?”</p>

  <p>Darkness fell limp for a moment upon hearing Aqua’s words, but quickly leapt to her feet.</p>

  <p>“Y-Yes, that man is just the start! There’s another man I’m actually worried about!”</p>

  <p>With a slight blush, Darkness declared to cover up her misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>“—Look into that alley. You’ll understand why I’m concerned at a glance.”</p>

  <p>Chris’s next destination was a shadowy alley.</p>

  <p>Following Darkness’s instructions, standing in the alley was a man in a white coat with a meat cleaver hanging off his hip.</p>

  <p>His white coat seemed stained with something, so I used Farsight to take a closer look, and those stains turned out to be blood…!</p>

  <p>“That’s the butcher. He specializes in dealing with chickens and other birds… Ah, Chris just received a bag of eggs from him. That’s a relief, Darkness. Seems like she’s just out on a shopping trip.”</p>

  <p>“Darkness, calm down. Rather than berating yourself, you should be thankful that nothing happened to Chris.”</p>

  <p>Darkness buried her face in her hands and seemed to grow smaller.</p>

  <p>—Just then,</p>

  <p>“Say, you guys have been following me since morning. What’s going on?”</p>

  <p>She must have closed the distance while Aqua and I were busy comforting Darkness.</p>

  <p>“—Ahahaha! How foolish of you, Darkness! I’m a devout follower of Eris who loves justice, you know? There’s no way I would end up bad people!”</p>

  <p>After hearing our explanation, Chris let out a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>“Kuh, I have nothing to say… To think that I would doubt a friend like that…”</p>

  <p>Chris let out a chuckle towards Darkness who fell onto her knees.</p>

  <p>“Heheheh, I’m actually happy about that. After all, it just means you care about me that much, right, Darkness?”</p>

  <p>“Uggh…. That might be true, but I judged others by their appearances and even cast my doubts on them. As a servant of Eris, I don’t think I can forgive myself…”</p>

  <p>Darkness seems to place a lot of importance on the weirdest things sometimes.</p>

  <p>Chris placed a hand on Darkness’s shoulder.</p>

  <p>“It’s fine, you might have gone a little overboard, but it’s all out of concern for a friend. I’m sure Eris-sama will forgive you.”</p>

  <p>As Chris said that with a smile, Aqua interjected with something completely unnecessary.</p>

  <p>“Do you really think so? She’s really serious and inflexible, so she might not actually forgive Darkness.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aqua-san, you’re just making Darkness more depressed, so cut it out!”</p>

  <p>Darkness buried her head between her knees and shut herself out from the world.</p>

  <p>Though, there was something that bothered me.</p>

  <p>“Say, Chris, you bought quite a lot of things today. What are you planning to make with that?”</p>

  <p>“Eh!? That’s, um, well…”</p>

  <p>Chris stuttered while trying and failing not to look at Darkness.</p>

  <p>So it has something to do with Darkness, then?</p>

  <p>“It’s a cake! Flour, sugar, and eggs is definitely for a cake! Chris, is the birthday of someone you know coming soon?”</p>

  <p>At Aqua’s sudden words, Darkness and Chris both seemed to stiffen up in shock.</p>

  <p>… Ah, I see what’s going on.</p>

  <p>“Right, Aqua, let’s go home. I’ll give you some money, so buy some delicious wine for later, okay?”</p>

  <p>Having her plans for a surprise party revealed, Chris stood with trembling shoulders and a red face.</p>

  <p>Darkness, too, was trembling in much the same way.</p>

  <p>I turned towards the two of them and said,</p>

  <p>“I’ll have Megumin cook up a lavish feast, so you two come home early, okay?”</p>

  <p>On the way home, I bought a stuffed toy for a certain someone who, despite being usually serious and stiff, has a soft spot for cute and fancy stuff.</p>
