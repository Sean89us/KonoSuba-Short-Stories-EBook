  <p>Bakuen 1 Short Story</p>

  <p>Occurrence: After Bakuen Volume 1</p>

  <p>Just what is happening?</p>

  <p>“Onii-chan, I want to eat frost lizard steak next!”</p>

  <p>“Leave it to me! Onii-chan is really strong! It doesn’t matter if you want a frost lizard or a salamander, it’ll be a cinch to me!”</p>

  <p>On the way back from school, I came across Bukkororii trying to bribe Komekko with food. This is probably something I should be reporting to the adults of the village…</p>

  <p>Though, this NEET is a rare lifeline to Komekko who’s still growing up, so I could turn a blind eye to this…</p>

  <p>“I’m going to become Onii-chan’s wife when I grow up!”</p>

  <p>“You damned NEET, how dare you seduce my sister!”</p>

  <p>“Wai-st-stop, Megumin! Why are you hitting me all of a sudden?!”</p>

  <p>- After hearing his explanation, it seems like Bukkororii found Komekko wandering around the village and is keeping an eye on her.</p>

  <p>Komekko would probably have ended up going into the nearby forest in search of food if left alone.</p>

  <p>“Listen up, Komekko, the forests around the village are full of strong monsters, so you must never go out of the village by yourself.”</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Komekko responded.</p>

  <p>“Even if I’m with the powerful Bukkororii?”</p>

  <p>“Definitely not. This NEET might be strong in combat, but if you go alone with him, it’d be dangerous in a different manner.”</p>

  <p>“What are you trying to say? I don’t have that kind of tastes!”</p>

  <p>Komekko looked at the two of us as we argued incessantly.</p>

  <p>“Who is stronger, Onee-san or Bukkororii?”</p>

  <p>“……”</p>

  <p>After a short silence, the two of us both pointed to ourselves.</p>

  <p>“Obviously it’s me, the number one genius in the village…”</p>

  <p>“Obviously it’s me, who spends a lot of time hunting monsters every day…”</p>

  <p>The two of us started squaring off in front of Komekko again.</p>

  <p>“… You didn’t forget how you cried after I pushed you into the pond when we were little, did you?”</p>

  <p>“… How long ago was that? I can do this now, you know!? Light of Reflection!”</p>

  <p>“Y-you bastard, how could you use magic during a quarrel with a girl who’s younger than you!?”</p>

  <p>I angrily shouted after Bukkororii who concealed himself with magic, and I heard his gloating voice ring out from somewhere in response.</p>

  <p>“Admit your defeat, Megumin! Don’t think I’m the same guy as when I was younger! Even if I face the Demon King’s Army…”</p>

  <p>“- Oh, isn’t that Megumin and Komekko?”</p>

  <p>The one who interrupted Bukkororii mid sentence is the owner of the number one shoe shop in the village. In other words, Bukkororii’s father.</p>

  <p>“I asked him to mind the store, and he ended up disappearing off somewhere. Have you two seen that wastrel around?”</p>

  <p>Komekko and I pointed at an empty spot in the air.</p>

  <p>“He should be around there.”</p>

  <p>As we said that, we heard frantic noises of someone quickly running away.</p>

  <p>And Bukkororii’s father cast a spell in that direction-</p>
