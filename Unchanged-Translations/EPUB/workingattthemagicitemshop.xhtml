  <p>“I’ll be in your care today.”</p>

  <p>“Thank you very much, Dust-san.”</p>

  <p>After waking up early and dragging myself to the magic item shop, the beautiful shopkeeper, Wiz, greeted me.</p>

  <p>“U-Um, I think it’s best not to hire Dust, but…”</p>

  <p>Standing next to the gently smiling Wiz and saying such unflattering words is Loli Succubus, once again as flat as usual.</p>

  <p>“Stop saying unnecessary things. It’s not like this has anything to do with you.”</p>

  <p>“True, I might not have a stake in this, but I have to protect this store while Vanir-sama is away.”</p>

  <p>It’s your business what you want to get excited over, but at this point, you’re basically just squatting here.</p>

  <p>“It’s fine. Usually, nothing much happens here, so there shouldn’t be any problem. Plus, it’s nice to have a guy around to lend a hand.”</p>

  <p>“It’s good to hear that it’d be an easy job. I can’t work at the guild for three days, so this really helped me out.”</p>

  <p>“Uugh… I can’t help but feel uneasy about this…”</p>

  <p>“There’s no need to worry. I’m the type of man who doesn’t do anything without being told, so you can relax.”</p>

  <p>“Umm, please properly do your work.”</p>

  <p>I come to this store every so often, and I hardly ever see any customers around, so it’ll be fine.</p>

  <p>After unloading some goods from the back rooms, I’m pretty much done with work.</p>

  <p>Cleaning and arranging the products on the shelves is all handled by Loli Succubus. There aren’t any customers, so Wiz simply stood in front of the counter with a smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Having run out of stuff to do, Loli Succubus went to the back rooms to clean up there.</p>

  <p>Seems like it’d really be an easy job after all.</p>

  <p>“Good day. Oh, is Vanir-san not in? I see, so he isn’t in.”</p>

  <p>A somewhat rotund man came into the store and took a look around.</p>

  <p>“Welcome. Oh, my, thank you for your help the other day.”</p>

  <p>Wiz came out and gave the man a bow. It seems like he’s an acquaintance of hers.</p>

  <p>“I’ve brought several items with me today.”</p>

  <p>“Er, well, Vanir-san told me not to take any more useless products. The staff that multiplies the power of any spell you cast by three that I bought from you the other day turned out to be a useless product that causes the caster to fall over from mana exhaustion after casting even beginner spells. Vanir-san got really mad at me over that.”</p>

  <p>Oh, so she actually does keep Sir Vanir’s instructions in mind.</p>

  <p>It seems like she’s learnt after buying so many items that turned out to be completely unsellable and being charred to a crisp by Sir’s mysterious beams each time.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry, this definitely isn’t a useless product. This item will definitely be a big hit with the town, so Vanir-san will definitely be happy with it too. I daresay that it’ll make him apologize for the way he’s treated you in the past.”</p>

  <p>“R-Really. Well, I’ll hear you out, at least.”</p>

  <p>“Hold it! Don’t change your mind so easily! And you, don’t take advantage of when Vanir-san isn’t here to offload your unsellable goods here. Get out!”</p>

  <p>“W-What is wrong with you? I came in here with a product that’ll definitely make us both rich.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, it’ll only make you rich.”</p>

  <p>I forcibly dragged the protesting man out of the store.</p>

  <p>So this is she ends up wasting so much money on useless goods. Sir Vanir sure does have his hands full.</p>

  <p>“Sir told you not to buy anything… Where did you come from?”</p>

  <p>Before I noticed it, Aqua was standing by the counter having a chat with Wiz.</p>

  <p>She must have slipped in while I was dealing with that man.</p>

  <p>“Listen to this, Wiz! Kazuma-san told me to stop coming to this store to play!”</p>

  <p>“Why would he do that? I’m more than happy to have you as our guest.”</p>

  <p>“Right? He said some incomprehensible things like you’re causing trouble for Vanir, so cut it out already.”</p>

  <p>No, you should understand it.</p>

  <p>You do nothing but cause problems in this store.</p>

  <p>“Ah, right, that’s not what I came here to for. Listen to this, I have a brilliant money making idea-”</p>

  <p>“The door is over there, please go home.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, you’ll receive divine punishment for grabbing a goddess’s neck!”</p>

  <p>“I’ll tell Kazuma that you’re causing trouble for Sir Vanir if you keep this up!”</p>

  <p>Aqua put up quite a bit more resistance than that merchant earlier, but I managed to get her out the door eventually.</p>

  <p>She stopped resisting once she heard Kazuma’s name, so she shouldn’t be a problem for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>Wait, wasn’t this supposed to be an easy job? Why do I feel so tired?</p>

  <p>Does Sir Vanir have to put up with this every day?</p>

  <p>Managing a store sure isn’t easy.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, I fended off a few other attempts from enterprising merchants to unload their wares here.</p>

  <p>I even managed to offload a few items onto Yunyun when she came in for a visit.</p>

  <p>All in all, it was a busy day.</p>

  <p>On the bright side, Sir Vanir was in a really good mood when he returned, and gave me a few extra eris on top of the money we agreed on.</p>

  <p>With this, I’ll be able to tide things over until I can take on quests again.</p>

  <p>Two days later, I found myself back at the magic item shop.</p>

  <p>“Umm, I’ve run out of money. So do you think I can work here for-”</p>

  <p>“The door is over there.”</p>
