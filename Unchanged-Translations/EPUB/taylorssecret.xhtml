  <p>“Say, Dust, can I ask you something?”</p>

  <p>Lynn called out to me as we were having a meal at our usual spot at the guild.</p>

  <p>“If you’re going to ask me what my type is, I ain’t answering.”</p>

  <p>“I’m not interested in that. Don’t you think Keith and Taylor have been acting a little weird recently?”</p>

  <p>And here I was concerned over what caused her to furrow her brow like that. So it’s about them.</p>

  <p>I don’t think anything’s particularly changed.</p>

  <p>“Weird in what way?”</p>

  <p>“You often go out with Keith, so have you noticed him doing anything on the sly? He was in a real panic when I called out to the both of you the other day.”</p>

  <p>“Did that happen?… I don’t remember.”</p>

  <p>The only thing that comes to mind is… that time when we ran into Lynn while we were making our way back from the Succubus shop.</p>

  <p>That store is a secret known only to the male adventurers. Even if it’s Lynn, there’s no way we can let her know about it.</p>

  <p>“Plus, he usually drinks every day, but recently, there are times when he doesn’t drink even when he has money. That applies to you too.”</p>

  <p>Yeah, that’s because we were saving up money to get the best dreams from the succubus.</p>

  <p>“That’s, well, we realized the value of having a healthy body. It’s important to take a break every now and then to give your livers time to rest, right?”</p>

  <p>“……”</p>

  <p>Don’t just stare at me like that. Say something.</p>

  <p>Doesn’t seem like she believes me at all. Well, it’s a poorly thought out lie anyway.</p>

  <p>“Well, I’ll ask more details about that later. The problem is Taylor.”</p>

  <p>“He doesn’t really go out with us.”</p>

  <p>We kept the existence of the Succubus shop a secret from Taylor.</p>

  <p>He’s pretty inflexible in some ways, so rather than making use of the services, there’s a decent chance that he’d end up lecturing us instead.</p>

  <p>“I would worry less if he was with you. Taylor seems to meet up with someone in secret every so often. I heard from a friend that he’s been repeatedly visiting a high class bar with someone else.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, wait, he has a girl!? Unforgivable!”</p>

  <p>And here I thought he had no luck with women! That traitor!</p>

  <p>… Still, I don’t recall him ever showing signs of that.</p>

  <p>“Thing is, it’s not a girl. He’s meeting with a man.”</p>

  <p>“Then it’s just a friend of his, right? Just leave it be. It’s best not to pry too deeply into your friend’s private matters. As long as it isn’t a criminal act, it’s best to leave it be.”</p>

  <p>“And who exactly was the one who got in the way when that nobleman consulted with me?”</p>

  <p>“Friends are really important, after all. Let’s keep an eye on him. He might be getting involved with some unsavoury folks, after all!”</p>

  <p>Lynn narrowed her eyes even further as I loudly proclaimed that.</p>

  <p>I got into a really horrible situation back then when I got Kazuma to help me take pictures, so let’s just keep watch from a distance this time.</p>

  <p>Two days later.</p>

  <p>After completing a job, Keith invited everyone to cool off at the bar, but Taylor refused.</p>

  <p>“Sorry, I have a prior appointment with someone.”</p>

  <p>Saying that, he left the guild before even eating dinner.</p>

  <p>Lynn and I turned Keith down too and followed after him.</p>

  <p>After arriving at the bar where he had been previously sighted at, Taylor walked in without any heed to his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Lynn and I entered with hoods drawn low over our faces.</p>

  <p>The shop was far more high class than the guild hall. Looking around, we spotted Taylor and sat down in the seat behind him.</p>

  <p>“This really does feel like a date with a woman.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t think so. The person sitting opposite Taylor is definitely a guy. I saw it when we sat down. I couldn’t make out his face, though…”</p>

  <p>Lynn and I whispered after sitting down.</p>

  <p>“Sorry for being late.”</p>

  <p>“No worries. I just arrived myself.”</p>

  <p>I think I’ve heard this voice before.</p>

  <p>It’s a little soft from where I’m sitting, so I can’t be certain, but… this voice is…</p>

  <p>“How was your day?”</p>

  <p>“There weren’t any particular issues. There are no complaints with Keith and Dust when it comes to their abilities, and Lynn has always been reliable.”</p>

  <p>Perhaps feeling elated that she got praised, Lynn excitedly prodded me in the side with her elbow.</p>

  <p>“Oh, I’m so jealous. Mine was absolutely horrible. The ones on my side don’t listen to anything I say at all. ”</p>

  <p>“I-I see. I’ve never teamed up with them, so I don’t know first hand what you’re going through, but I’ve heard how horrible they can be from Dust.”</p>

  <p>Yeah, the one Taylor is talking to is definitely Kazuma.</p>

  <p>“That’s Kazuma, right? I didn’t know they were so close. Do they feel some kind of kinship from being the leaders of their party?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe. Still, there’s no reason to keep this secret.”</p>

  <p>It’s not anything remarkable for two men to grab some drinks together.</p>

  <p>And here I was expecting something much more scandalous.</p>

  <p>… Of course, the moment I thought that, they started complaining non-stop about their respective party members.</p>

  <p>Kazuma had a lot of complaints, of course, and I mostly agree with him. Taylor doesn’t seem to have any complaints about Lynn, but…</p>

  <p>“Doesn’t most of his complaints concern me?”</p>

  <p>“There’s nothing wrong with what he’s saying… Oh, I see now. The reason why they’re doing this on the sly is to prevent their companions from learning about their complaints.”</p>

  <p>…Let’s just go home.</p>
