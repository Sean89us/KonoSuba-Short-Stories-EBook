  <h1>Megumin the Dragon Slayer</h1>

  <p>Occurrence: After Volume 1</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>At a quarry close to town.</p>

  <p>“Right, Ojou-chan, I’ll leave it in your hands.”</p>

  <p>“Heh, leave it to me. Feast your eyes, for I shall demonstrate a glimpse of my true power right here! Were I serious, this entire quarry…! Ah, could you stand a little bit further back? Yeah, there’ll do.”</p>

  <p>The chief civil engineer and Megumin were discussing how to proceed with their blast.</p>

  <p>However…</p>

  <p>“Why do I have to accompany you?”</p>

  <p>“I don’t have a choice. I won’t be able to move after using my magic, so I’ll need you to carry me home.”</p>

  <p>For some reason, I was dragged along to the quarry too.</p>

  <p>“I don’t need to be here for that. You could just let the civil engineer uncle carry you back. He’s probably stronger than I am.”</p>

  <p>“What kind of nonsense are you saying? Take a look at this heavyset, beastlike man. If I was left alone with this man, unable to move, who knows what he would do to a frail girl like me?”</p>

  <p>“That won’t happen!”</p>

  <p>“Hey! Why are you two screaming like that!? Why don’t you explain it to me in detail!?”</p>

  <p>Megumin raised her staff, her eyes glowing red. Seeing that, the civil engineer hastily said,</p>

  <p>“W-Well, leaving that aside, our objective is that giant boulder. We can’t get to work with that in the way. I discussed this issue with the guild, and they recommended you to me. So, what do you think? Are you up to it?”</p>

  <p>“Of course! My Name Is Megumin! The one who will eventually slay the Demon King! A rock like that is but a pittance compared to…”</p>

  <p>“Pii~! Pii~!”</p>

  <p>….?</p>

  <p>A bird-like cry suddenly rang out, causing us to exchange confused looks.</p>

  <p>Looking closely at that boulder, I could see a bird nest-like object perched on the top.</p>

  <p>“Oh, that’s a wyvern! A wyvern hatchling! My god, to think that something like this could be nesting so close to town… But it’s good that you are here, Ojou-chan. Blow it away along with that rock. It may be a hatchling, but wyverns are highly aggressive carnivores. If we let it be, it’ll cause widespread damage in the future. Its parents aren’t here, so it’s a great chance to get rid of it.”</p>

  <p>“Ah!”</p>

  <p>Hearing the engineer’s words, Megumin let out a squeak.</p>

  <p>Megumin looked at the small wyvern as it constantly chirped.</p>

  <p>It’s probably tough for her to end such a defenceless creature, but as adventurers, we can’t let dangerous monsters roam free.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the target is a wyvern. When it grows up, it’ll definitely become a serious threat to humanity.</p>

  <p>But Megumin…</p>

  <p>“U..uuu…”</p>

  <p>Had an uncertain expression on her face, and didn’t move.</p>

  <p>In the end, Megumin opted not to cast her spell, and dejectedly hung her head before us.</p>

  <p>Seeing her, the engineer scratched his head and smiled.</p>

  <p>“Hah, well, I guess it can’t be helped! It’s probably too cruel a job for an Ojou-chan. I’ll call you back to destroy that boulder after the wyvern has left the nest!”</p>

  <p>The engineer let out a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>Megumin seemed to brighten up upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>“Let’s take it down in a proper battle once it’s grown up.”</p>

  <p>I said with a smile.</p>

  <p>“Still, you missed out on a great chance there, Ojou-chan. It may be young, but you’d still become a Wyvern Slayer after killing it. And wyverns are also a type of dragon. You’ll be able to call yourself a Dragon Slayer after that.”</p>

  <p>The engineer joked.</p>

  <p>I joined in his laughter.</p>

  <p>“You can call yourself a Dragon Slayer even if you defeat a hatchling? That’s nice, isn’t it? It definitely sounds like the title of a hero who will defeat the Demon King-”</p>

  <p>“Explosion-!”</p>

  <p>Megumin interrupted me with her spell.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a loud boom resonated throughout the quarry, followed by a strong shockwave.</p>

  <p>The sudden spell gave us no time to prepare ourselves, and the engineer and I both ended up getting blown over.</p>

  <p>Laying on the ground, I slightly shifted to look at my surroundings.</p>

  <p>The engineer must have hit himself on the head; he was showing the whites of his eyes and seemed completely out of it.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Megumin lay collapsed on the ground after expending her magic. Without lifting her head, she proudly said,</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Megumin! Wielder of explosion magic, and the one who defeated a dragon! Kazuma, please call me ’Dragon Slayer Megumin’ from now on.”</p>

  <p>“You little piece of… Can’t you just let things end happily for once!?”</p>
