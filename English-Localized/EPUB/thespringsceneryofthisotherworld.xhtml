  <p>Just after noon, warm sunlight streamed gently through the window.</p>

  <p>I was enjoying a short post-lunch nap by the window when a sudden loud noise obliterated the cozy atmosphere.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma! Kazuma! Let’s go see the blossoms! The cherry trees are gorgeous today!”</p>

  <p>Aqua being that cheerful gave me a bad feeling, so I kept pretending to sleep.</p>

  <p>“…Are you sleeping? Hey, Kazuma, you’re awake, aren’t you?”</p>

  <p>Just as Aqua started shaking me,</p>

  <p>“Aqua, it’s too cruel to force a sleeping man awake. Let’s just enjoy the flower viewing with the three of us.”</p>

  <p>“True… Kazuma must be worn out from all his adventures. Let’s enjoy the flowers without him.”</p>

  <p>Megumin and Darkness said, and Aqua reluctantly backed off.</p>

  <p>“It would’ve been more fun with more people, but… oh well. We even managed to get some high-quality snacks to go with the wine.”</p>

  <p>…High-quality snacks.</p>

  <p>No, no, no. Don’t fall for it. Nothing good ever comes from getting involved with plants in this world.</p>

  <p>Even if this world had cherry blossoms, they’d be the kind that spit sap in your eyes and slice you to ribbons with razor vines.</p>

  <p>Then Aqua would cry, Darkness would clutch her head, Megumin would blow up the whole area, and I’d have to clean up after them.</p>

  <p>I shoved any thoughts of high-quality snacks out of my mind and stayed perfectly still…</p>

  <p>“After all, the cherry blossom spirits always show up completely naked. It’d be too much excitement for Kazuma, so…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, what are you three doing!? Hurry up and grab your stuff! You didn’t forget the wine, did you? Alright, let’s go!”</p>

  <p>When I bolted upright and started barking orders, the three of them stared at me like I was walking garbage—</p>

  <p>—Cherry blossoms.</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! Kazuma! Kazuma! Please save me!”</p>

  <p>The flower that heralded spring. The one every Japanese person loved.</p>

  <p>“Kuzuma, quick, pour the wine on the ground! The cherry blossom spirits will go back into the earth to drink once you do!”</p>

  <p>—Cherry blossoms.</p>

  <p>“A Crimson Demon like me isn’t going to lose to some stupid plant! Buy me time! I’ll blow them all away with Explosion!!”</p>

  <p>A flower that only bloomed for a short time—and that’s exactly why people adored it.</p>

  <p>“Don’t look down on us Japanese! Even if I die, I’m getting a good look at you cherry blossom spirits!”</p>

  <p>I stopped Darkness just as she started to pour the wine.</p>

  <p>“Come on! Face me!!!”</p>

  <p>With a yell, I charged straight into the cloud of petals—</p>

  <p>In the end, Aqua cried, Darkness clutched her head, Megumin used Explosion and blew up the entire area, and I had to pay for one destroyed cherry tree.</p>
