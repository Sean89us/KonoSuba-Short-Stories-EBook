  <p>[Originally linked by Natsume from his blog on May 2nd, 2014, this story (and several more!) was never officially published. It might be that he dropped them, or that they didn’t make the cut (or maybe he just wanted to have fun?). In any case, this takes place around volume 4, so the status quo and character relationships are a little different from the later volumes. Thanks to Striker for digging these up.]</p>

  <p>One afternoon, out of nowhere…</p>

  <p>“Man, I’d really like to see a <i>real</i> mage at least once.”</p>

  <p>After a light meal at the guild, I muttered that into my tea.</p>

  <p>Sitting across from me, Megumin dropped her spoon.</p>

  <p>“…W-what did you just say?”</p>

  <p>“Huh? I just said I want to see a real mage at least once. There are plenty of spellcasters in this town, but they don’t match the image I have in my head.”</p>

  <p>At that, the entire atmosphere of the guild shifted.</p>

  <p>“…Kazuma, are you picking a fight with the mage sitting right in front of you?” Megumin demanded. “As a Crimson Demon—famous for producing exceptional mages—I can’t let that slide. Describe your ‘ideal mage.’ If there’s even one person in town who fits it, you’re apologizing.”</p>

  <p>“I’m not picking a fight. It’s just that, to me, a mage is…”</p>

  <p>Megumin slammed the table, and several adventurers nearby nodded along like I’d insulted their ancestors.</p>

  <p>“…Someone who takes magic seriously and refuses to waste it on trivial things,” I said. “Like using Tinder to warm up bar snacks while drinking. Or casting Blizzard in the stables on a hot night, then getting chewed out the next morning for soaking everything…”</p>

  <p>A few tables over, a guy roasting squid over a plate stiffened. Several others did too.</p>

  <p>“And there’s the one who complained the public baths were cold, tossed a fireball in, and scalded himself. And the guy who uses the instant-kill spell he’s so proud of for construction work…”</p>

  <p>“Stop! Please stop!” Megumin cried. “I admit we aren’t that great, so just… don’t say any more!”</p>

  <p>Seeing people shift uncomfortably in their seats, I decided to leave it there and circle back to my original point.</p>

  <p>“Anyway. I want to see a proper mage. Like… calm. Mild-mannered. Wise. Not ‘depending on the mood, you blast offensive spells and pick fights with muscle-headed front-liners.’”</p>

  <p>“I-I’m plenty mild-mannered…! S-sorry! I’m sorry for throwing Explosion around without thinking! Stop looking at me like that!”</p>

  <p>“Anyway, do we have anyone here who owns a grimoire? Someone whose actual job is deciphering old magical texts?”</p>

  <p>All the mages who’d been listening leaned away and suddenly found the floor very interesting.</p>

  <p>“Not a single one!? Researching lost magic, refining magic circle design, experimenting with alchemy—anything! Aren’t mages basically scholars? …Hey, you’re burning the squid!”</p>

  <p>In a dimly lit room, a hooded figure chanted in a heavy voice, like she was invoking something forbidden.</p>

  <p>“O great power of the earth, waters born from the source of life… Red… red… the fresh crimson fruit of the devil…! Unite with the flesh of the beast, and be transformed by the heat of my flames into what you were meant to be!”</p>

  <p>The robed figure raised both hands as the pot before her released an excellent scent.</p>

  <p>“O you, now perfected in your most appetizing form—become my blood, my flesh, and the source of my power!”</p>

  <p>Megumin grinned, tossed back her hood, and ladled toad-meat stew onto a plate.</p>

  <p>“…This is just stew, right?” I asked. “Do you really need a whole suspicious ritual to make it?”</p>

  <p>“Of course. Such is the power of words. By invoking them, the bruised ingredients we bought cheaply are reborn as high-quality cuisine.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, so magic can do that too. When you said you’d show me your ‘wizardly side’ and immediately started cooking, I almost went home… So it really is a ritual.”</p>

  <p>“No, I’m lying. This is normal stew. I just said those lines for the atmosphere—ow, ow, ow! I’m sorry, stop!”</p>

  <p>As I tugged Megumin’s cheeks, I heard frantic footsteps outside the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Megumin had said she’d show me a “real” ritual and borrowed the guild kitchen, but apparently that hadn’t been the end of it…</p>

  <p>“Hurry up and get ready while the Crimson Demon girl buys us time! We’re going to show that guy real magic…!”</p>

  <p>“How do you draw a magic circle again!? Does anyone remember the familiar-summoning one!?”</p>

  <p>“Crystal balls feel mage-like, right? Where do you even buy those!?”</p>

  <p>As the spellcasters raised hell outside, I took a sip of Megumin’s stew.</p>

  <p>“Sorry. I didn’t think one careless remark would cause an incident…” I said. “This is really good.”</p>

  <p>“Spellcasters tend to be a prideful bunch,” Megumin said. “Be careful next time. …Want seconds?”</p>

  <p>She was ladling me another serving when the kitchen doors flew open.</p>

  <p>“Preparations complete! Now, we’ll show you what a true mage looks like!”</p>

  <p>How did my life end up like this?</p>

  <p>“Heheheh… Now listen. When you think ‘mage,’ what comes to mind is, of course—!”</p>

  <p>“If you say ‘magical girl’ at your age, I’m going to smack you.”</p>

  <p>“Gurk…! *sniffle*…”</p>

  <p>A woman in an excessively frilly gothic-lolita outfit backed away with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>“…Really? I thought a mage should be an old bearded geezer, so I went out and bought a mustache…”</p>

  <p>“I-I’ve been catching pigeons in the park so I could make them appear from a handkerchief…!”</p>

  <p>That wasn’t magic. That was a street trick.</p>

  <p>Just as the spellcasters started arguing loudly among themselves…</p>

  <p>“So what exactly is this ‘real mage’ thing you’re talking about?” asked a woman in a bunny-girl outfit standing next to the pigeon guy. “What kind of magic did you have in mind?”</p>

  <p>…Had I accidentally asked the spellcasters in this town to do something impossible?</p>

  <p>Like building a gingerbread house?</p>

  <p>No, that was a fairy tale. If I raised the bar any higher, I’d probably make every candy shop owner and child in town cry.</p>

  <p>Mage, mage… What else do mages do…?</p>

  <p>“Oh—fly,” I said. “You know, ride a staff and fly through the sky—”</p>

  <p>Judging from their expressions, that was not happening.</p>

  <p>“…Fly,” the bunny girl repeated. “Okay. Fly. If we can fly, you’ll acknowledge us as true mages, right!?”</p>

  <p>She said it with such determination I could feel the willpower radiating off her.</p>

  <p>Just as I started to feel genuinely bad for bruising their pride…</p>

  <p>“Sleep!”</p>

  <p>At that voice, I…</p>

  <p>…Huh…?</p>

  <p>When I woke up, I was wrapped in a thick futon and tied to a broomstick.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know how we got here, but a clearly nervous Megumin stood in front of me with her staff at the ready.</p>

  <p>“K-Kazuma… Everyone agreed that, theoretically, it should be within the safe limit. I think it checks out too. There’ll be people waiting at the landing point to catch you with wind magic, so…!”</p>

  <p>As the other mages watched with rigid, terrified smiles, Megumin swallowed hard and started her Explosion chant…</p>

  <p>“Okay, okay, I’m sorry! You’re all exceptional mages! But also—why are you making <i>me</i> fly!?”</p>
