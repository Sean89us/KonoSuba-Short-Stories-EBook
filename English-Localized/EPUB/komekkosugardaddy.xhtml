  <p>What in the world is going on here?</p>

  <p>“Big Bro, I want frost lizard steak next!”</p>

  <p>“Leave it to me! Big Bro’s super strong! Frost lizard, salamander—whatever you want, it’ll be easy!”</p>

  <p>On my way home from school, I found Bukkororii bribing Komekko with food. This is probably something I should report to the village adults…</p>

  <p>Then again, this NEET is a rare lifeline for Komekko while she’s still growing, so maybe I could look the other way…</p>

  <p>“When I grow up, I’m going to marry Big Bro!”</p>

  <p>“You damn NEET—how dare you seduce my sister!”</p>

  <p>“W-wait, stop, Megumin! Why are you hitting me all of a sudden?!”</p>

  <p>—After hearing his explanation, it turns out Bukkororii found Komekko wandering around the village and decided to keep an eye on her.</p>

  <p>If left alone, Komekko probably would’ve wandered into the nearby forest looking for food.</p>

  <p>“Listen, Komekko. The forests around the village are full of dangerous monsters, so you can’t go outside the village by yourself.”</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Komekko responded.</p>

  <p>“Even if I’m with strong Bukkororii?”</p>

  <p>“Absolutely not. This NEET might be strong in a fight, but being alone with him is dangerous in a different way.”</p>

  <p>“What are you trying to say!? I’m not into that!”</p>

  <p>Komekko looked at the two of us as we argued incessantly.</p>

  <p>“Who’s stronger, Big Sis or Bukkororii?”</p>

  <p>“…”</p>

  <p>After a short silence, both of us pointed at ourselves.</p>

  <p>“Obviously me—the village’s number-one genius…”</p>

  <p>“Obviously me—I spend every day hunting monsters…”</p>

  <p>The two of us started squaring off in front of Komekko again.</p>

  <p>“…You haven’t forgotten how you cried after I pushed you into the pond when we were little, have you?”</p>

  <p>“…How long ago was that? I can do this now, you know!? Light of Reflection!”</p>

  <p>“Y-you jerk, how could you use magic in a fight with a girl younger than you!?”</p>

  <p>I shouted angrily at Bukkororii as he hid himself with magic, and his smug voice called back from somewhere nearby.</p>

  <p>“Admit your defeat, Megumin! I’m not the same guy I was back then! Even if I had to face the Demon King’s Army…”</p>

  <p>“- Oh, isn’t that Megumin and Komekko?”</p>

  <p>The one who interrupted Bukkororii mid-sentence was the owner of the village’s number-one shoe shop. In other words, Bukkororii’s father.</p>

  <p>“I told him to mind the store, and he went and disappeared somewhere. Have you two seen that wastrel?”</p>

  <p>Komekko and I pointed at empty air.</p>

  <p>“He should be right around there.”</p>

  <p>As we said that, we heard frantic footsteps as someone bolted away.</p>

  <p>And Bukkororii’s father cast a spell in that direction—</p>
