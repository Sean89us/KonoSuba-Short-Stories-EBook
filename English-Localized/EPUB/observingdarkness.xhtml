  <hr/>

  <p>While I was at the adventurers’ guild, looking for easy, profitable quests like I always do, I got a strange, “off the record” request from Kazuma. It seems the guild views him as the caretaker of his party, so they keep making him clean up after their messes.</p>

  <p>He wanted me to investigate what his party gets up to when he’s not around.</p>

  <p>He’s a close friend I owe a lot to, and he even promised a decent reward, so I had no reason to refuse.</p>

  <p>In that case… today, I’ll observe Darkness the crusader.</p>

  <p>I’ve tailed her before, but I had company then. Doing it alone will make it easier to move around.</p>

  <p>While I watched Kazuma’s mansion that morning, I saw Darkness fling the door open and storm out.</p>

  <p>“This is a waste of my time! I don’t want to spend any more of it on a lazy bum like Kazuma… Wait, this is…”</p>

  <p>“Don’t bother. You shouldn’t concern yourself with that thing, Darkness.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry, Megumin. I’ll definitely drag him out to hunt monsters tomorrow, so just wait.”</p>

  <p>With that, Megumin and Darkness left the house in a huff.</p>

  <p>Looks like Kazuma refused to accompany them on a quest.</p>

  <p>Now that he has a big mansion and a mountain of money, who would want to keep doing a job as dangerous as adventuring? I get it.</p>

  <p>Darkness split off from Megumin and headed toward the adventurers’ guild.</p>

  <p>I followed her in.</p>

  <p>“Giant toad subjugation, huh… Getting swallowed whole and covered in slime from head to toe… Isn’t this the perfect opponent? Why do Aqua and Megumin hate them so much? It’s not fair. I’m the only one who hasn’t experienced it yet…”</p>

  <p>Darkness mumbled something to herself as she stared at the Giant Toad Subjugation quest.</p>

  <p>After standing there for a while, she finally seemed to accept that she couldn’t handle it alone, and went to the counter to talk to Luna.</p>

  <p>“Excuse me. I’m on my own today—are there any adventurers who could team up with me?”</p>

  <p>“Ah, teaming up with Darkness… Um, well, everyone seems to be pretty busy…”</p>

  <p>Luna averted her gaze.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the adventurers who were clearly free and lazing around the guild, and every one of them hurriedly looked away.</p>

  <p>“Ah, I have a job lined up after this! Oh, no, it’s already this late.”</p>

  <p>“Come to think of it, today’s my little brother’s birthday. I should hurry home.”</p>

  <p>“Oh dear, I seem to have had a few too many. If only I weren’t so drunk.”</p>

  <p>Voices like that echoed throughout the guild.</p>

  <p>I understood exactly how they felt. Once you’ve teamed up with Darkness once, you never want to do it again.</p>

  <p>Unable to land a hit, charging straight at an enemy the moment she sees one, and—worst of all—a genuine pervert who’ll dash right into the path of her allies’ spells.</p>

  <p>Only with Kazuma in the party can those tendencies be kept even remotely in check.</p>

  <p>“Everyone seems pretty busy. Forget it then.”</p>

  <p>At those words, everyone in the guild let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>She might be a top-tier front-liner, but if that front-liner charges straight into a mob without warning, you’re better off not partying with her at all.</p>

  <p>After that, Darkness still tried to accept the giant toad subjugation quest alone, but Luna eventually talked her out of it. Reluctantly giving up, Darkness left the guild.</p>

  <p>“She’s standing there by herself. Just what is she doing?”</p>

  <p>When she reached the town square, Darkness—for some reason—just stood there and stared at the fountain.</p>

  <p>It reminded me of someone.</p>

  <p>Don’t tell me—does this girl have no friends either?</p>

  <p>Lately, Yunyun’s become a familiar sight—she spends most of her time on her own. When she has nothing to do, she just stares blankly at the passersby. Just like this.</p>

  <p>Apart from Kazuma’s party and Chris, Darkness doesn’t seem to interact much with anyone else.</p>

  <p>Kazuma’s a pretty swell guy, so everyone gets along well with him.</p>

  <p>That self-proclaimed goddess is pretty popular too, thanks to her party tricks.</p>

  <p>And while no one wants to party up with that explosion brat, she still somehow has people hanging around her. She even followed me around with a bunch of strange girls a while back.</p>

  <p>And Darkness… Well, she has her own duties apart from being an adventurer, so she should be pretty busy. I suppose it’s fine.</p>

  <p>At the very least, she isn’t as bad off as Yunyun.</p>

  <p>After that, Darkness started wandering the city. For some reason, she seemed to be deliberately heading down shady backstreets.</p>

  <p>Her eyes seemed to sparkle as she walked down the deserted streets, and she was panting excitedly with a flushed face… Nah, it was probably just my imagination.</p>

  <p>After circling the street in front of the suspicious-looking shop several times, she headed back home with a dejected expression.</p>

  <p>Even though nothing happened, it still left me exhausted.</p>
