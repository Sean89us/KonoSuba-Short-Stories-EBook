  <p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>

  <p>One day…</p>

  <p>Aqua and I were in the middle of a full-on argument about who got the “special seat” right in front of the fireplace when someone started pounding on the front door.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t any of our usual visitors. Even Megumin and Darkness paused their game and looked over.</p>

  <p>“Excuse me! This is the residence of Kazuma Satou and his party, correct!? I need to speak with you, so please open the door!”</p>

  <p>The voice sounded panicked.</p>

  <p>And after hearing that…</p>

  <p>“All right, that’s enough. Go away already. I would also like to enjoy the crackle of firewood from time to time.”</p>

  <p>“I want to feed the fire, too. Nothing beats sitting here in winter and watching the flames dance. Kazuma, just sit behind me. You can hear the crackling from there.”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, I’ll defeat you today! I move my crusader all the way up to your archmage. Next turn, I’m taking you off the board!”</p>

  <p>“Teleport.”</p>

  <p>All four of us collectively decided to pretend we heard nothing.</p>

  <p>“Hey! I know you’re in there! I can hear you! Open up! Hurry up… It’s starting to snow! It’s freezing out here, so open the door!”</p>

  <p>It was a town police officer.</p>

  <p>We finally let him in and let him thaw out in front of the fireplace. Once he’d regained feeling in his fingers, he pulled out a document and shoved it toward Megumin.</p>

  <p>“Archmage Megumin, you’re suspected of involvement in the serial explosions plaguing Axel! Please come with me to the station!”</p>

  <p>Megumin didn’t hesitate for even a second. She snatched the paper out of his hand and tossed it straight into the fireplace.</p>

  <p>“Ah! That’s an official document! What are you doing!?”</p>

  <p>“Who cares!? What even is this ‘serial explosions’ thing!? I don’t know what it is, but there’s no way I committed a crime!”</p>

  <p>Honestly, if I were the officer, Megumin would’ve been my first suspect too. But Megumin was genuinely furious at getting accused out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>“Okay, okay, both of you, calm down,” Darkness said. “Officer, could you explain what this ‘serial explosions’ case actually is?”</p>

  <p>The officer gave up on trying to rescue the paper from the flames and explained instead.</p>

  <p>“Recently, there’s been an explosion almost every day around Axel. Usually in the forest or the mountains… and because of that, monsters get driven out onto the plains, and the mountains have been seeing constant avalanches. Both areas are now restricted.”</p>

  <p>“I look away for one second and this is what you get up to,” I told Megumin. “We’ll send you gifts in prison, so just accept your fate.”</p>

  <p>I patted her shoulder in sympathy. She smacked my hand away like it was poisonous.</p>

  <p>“Hold it! Those incidents have nothing to do with me! If I cast Explosion in the mountains, there’s a high chance I’d get swept away by an avalanche—so I’ve never done that! And lately, Darkness has been coming with me on my Explosion trips, so she can prove I wasn’t there! Right, Darkness?”</p>

  <p>“Eeh? Um. Er…”</p>

  <p>“Darkness, why are you hesitating!? You’re going to make this worse! Don’t tell me you don’t believe me either! Say it like you mean it!”</p>

  <p>Faced with Megumin’s desperate glare, Darkness quietly looked away.</p>

  <p>I stepped in. “All right, more questions. You said it’s every day. How many times a day?”</p>

  <p>“One explosion per day.”</p>

  <p>“And when do they happen?”</p>

  <p>“Right around the time Megumin leaves town.”</p>

  <p>“I’m sorry,” I said quickly, “she really doesn’t mean any harm. She just has a short fuse and—”</p>

  <p>“Wait, Kazuma,” Megumin snapped, grabbing my shoulders and shaking me, “why does that make you think it’s definitely me!?”</p>

  <p>I mean… if there’s one person in town who would do something this stupid, it’s her.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry,” I told her. “I’ll feed your black demonic beast every day while you’re locked up.”</p>

  <p>“Prison gets cold this time of year,” Darkness added, helpful as always. “Pack warm clothes. I’ll send you hot food every day.”</p>

  <p>“You too!?” Megumin yelled. “Fine! I’ll cooperate with your investigation to the bitter end! Officer, you have a lie-detecting magic item at the station, right? Use that! Prove I’m telling the truth!”</p>

  <p>Waving her staff like it was a weapon, Megumin stormed off after the officer toward the station.</p>

  <p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

  <p>“I’m terribly sorry! To think we suspected an innocent person…!”</p>

  <p>“Yes, exactly! And why is it that whenever anything ‘explodes,’ you immediately think it’s me!? I truly don’t understand!”</p>

  <p>Megumin returned from the station escorted by someone who looked like the police chief.</p>

  <p>Apparently the lie-detecting magic item hadn’t reacted at all.</p>

  <p>“Come on,” I said. “Your name’s been cleared. There’s no reason to be this mad. Besides, I always knew it would end this way.”</p>

  <p>“Of course I believe you,” Darkness added. “Megumin isn’t the kind of girl who’d do that. I don’t have anything to feel guilty about, so you can have the special seat by the fireplace if you want.”</p>

  <p>“You must be freezing after all that time outside,” Aqua said. “I’ll buy expensive ingredients and cook you something amazing tonight so you can warm up properly.”</p>

  <p>Megumin stared at all three of us. “You change your tune fast. What do you think I am?”</p>

  <p>After apologizing one last time to a still-simmering Megumin, the police chief turned to us and bowed.</p>

  <p>“Once again, I’m deeply sorry. You’re Kazuma Satou, yes? I’ve heard quite a few rumors about you. That you played a major role in defeating one of the Demon King’s generals, that you stopped the Destroyer…”</p>

  <p>She smiled as she spoke.</p>

  <p>She was gorgeous—maybe in her twenties—with long brown hair tied back in a ponytail.</p>

  <p>“No, no,” I said modestly. “It wasn’t that big a deal. I just couldn’t run away, thanks to my pride as an adventurer…”</p>

  <p>The chief looked at me with sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>“You’re being humble, Satou! I’ve heard this mansion is yours as well. That must be thanks to the huge bounty you earned after defeating the Destroyer and Beldia! Ah—my apologies, I haven’t introduced myself. I’m the police chief, Aloerina. Pleased to meet you.”</p>

  <p>For some reason, Aloerina edged closer as she said it.</p>

  <p>I mean, I was basically a local hero, so… sure. That tracked.</p>

  <p>“N-Nice to meet you,” I said. “I get why you’d think that, but honestly, a lot happened after that, and I ended up buried in debt too. Speaking of which, if you know what happened back then—”</p>

  <p>“Well, I’ve taken up enough of your time. Megumin, I’ll be taking my leave.”</p>

  <p>The instant she heard the word “debt,” Aloerina snapped back into professional mode.</p>

  <p>Yeah. That also tracked.</p>

  <p>“Chief Aloerina,” Darkness said, “if Megumin isn’t the culprit, do you have any idea who is?”</p>

  <p>“Er… no. We didn’t exactly expect there to be someone besides Megumin leaving town and setting off random explosions, so…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, I asked this already,” Megumin snapped. “Why does everyone automatically jump to me whenever there’s an explosion!? Tell me!”</p>

  <p>You reap what you sow.</p>

  <p>I wanted to say it out loud. But Megumin’s eyes were starting to glow again, so I decided I valued my life.</p>

  <p>“Whoever it is,” I said, “at least we know it’s not us. It’d be a huge pain if we got dragged into every tiny incident in this town…”</p>

  <p>And the moment I said that—</p>

  <p>“Yeah, exactly,” the useless goddess planted in front of the fireplace said. “Some other explosion expert besides Megumin is out there causing trouble. Honestly, the fact they managed to frame Megumin means they’re pretty skilled. They might even be better at Explosion than her.”</p>

  <p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>

  <p>The next day.</p>

  <p>“We’ll start by investigating anyone connected to the incidents,” Megumin declared. “I’ll use my Crimson Demon intelligence to sniff out the culprit.”</p>

  <p>I, a person who’d been dragged out of bed at an hour no sane human should be conscious, shuffled after her toward the adventurers’ guild.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Aqua’s big mouth, Megumin had developed a personal grudge and vowed on the spot to catch whoever was doing this.</p>

  <p>I planned to let her play detective on her own… until Chief Aloerina insisted on coming along.</p>

  <p>“Please, Megumin! If you have the police chief with you, you’ll have much more freedom to investigate,” she’d said.</p>

  <p>So there we were: Megumin, me, and Chief Aloerina walking behind us.</p>

  <p>“We’re doing this on a whim,” Megumin muttered. “You really don’t need to come.”</p>

  <p>“No. Even if you’re adventurers, I can’t let ordinary civilians chase what could be a dangerous Explosion user,” Aloerina said. “And my instincts as police chief tell me I’ll get to the bottom of this by sticking close. I’m not here because I still suspect you. It’s just that if I help you two, I might win favor with Lady Dustiness, your party member!”</p>

  <p>She didn’t so much “make an excuse” as she did announce her motives at full volume.</p>

  <p>Still, I’d bet good money she absolutely still suspected Megumin.</p>

  <p>If I let Megumin run around town alone with the chief, I had a feeling she’d end the day in handcuffs.</p>

  <p>So I got dragged along as “support.”</p>

  <p>“Fine,” Megumin said. “Let’s start with some questions.”</p>

  <p>Before I knew it, we were at the guild.</p>

  <p>Darkness had decided to investigate through her own contacts and left early, too.</p>

  <p>As for the one who’d started this whole mess with her unnecessary comment, Aqua had zero intention of moving from the fireplace. Since she was useless anyway, I left her there.</p>

  <p>It was still early, so the place was mostly empty. We went to the counter.</p>

  <p>“Excuse me,” I said. “Could I ask a few questions? I want to clarify a few things about the recent explosions.”</p>

  <p>“Good morning, Kazuma Satou. The recent explosions…” The receptionist looked up, then froze. “Eh? Ah!? You’re the police chief! And Megumin is here too… Explosions… Megumin… Police chief… Ah, I see. I understand what you’re asking. I also think Megumin is the most likely culprit.”</p>

  <p>“Hey!” Megumin snapped. “Tell me exactly what misunderstanding you have. I’d love to hear it!”</p>

  <p>“No, I understand why you’d say that, but that’s not it,” I said. “The investigation’s already over. The lie-detecting item didn’t react at all.”</p>

  <p>“Really? Could the item be defective?” the receptionist asked.</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina shook her head. “No. We used the newest set at the station, and it worked fine before yesterday. What we thought would be an easy case became an impenetrable riddle.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, if you’re picking a fight with me, I’ll happily take you on!” Megumin hissed, her eyes starting to glow again.</p>

  <p>I ignored her and got back to the point.</p>

  <p>“How many people in this town can use explosive spells? Anyone like that registered with the guild?”</p>

  <p>The explosive series had three spells: Blast, Detonation, and Explosion.</p>

  <p>Blast was strong enough to crack rock at a reasonable mana cost. Detonation cost more mana, but it hit hard enough to drop most monsters in one shot.</p>

  <p>“Spellcasters skilled enough for Blast usually leave town after a few levels,” the receptionist said. “And there aren’t many who can use Detonation in this country. During festival season, some get invited to put on fireworks, but they wouldn’t be around this time of year. So the only people in town who can use explosive magic right now should be the magic item shop owner and Megumin…”</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina narrowed her eyes. “Just to confirm… it really isn’t you?”</p>

  <p>“Do you have to ask again!?” Megumin snapped. “Haven’t we already proven it isn’t me!?”</p>

  <p>Watching them go at it again, I thought hard.</p>

  <p>The only other person in town I knew who could use explosive magic was Wiz, but it was hard to imagine her doing this. I couldn’t think of a motive.</p>

  <p>Motive…</p>

  <p>“Oh. Motive,” I said. “Maybe someone has a grudge against Megumin and is trying to frame her. Megumin, did you tick anyone off recently?”</p>

  <p>“Of course not,” Megumin said proudly. “I’m confident I’m the most likable person in this party.”</p>

  <p>Where did she get that confidence?</p>

  <p>The receptionist hesitated, then said, “Um… well… there have been several complaints about Megumin lately. There was one where she cast Explosion on a group of goblins right as another team cornered them—stealing their kills and catching them in the blast… and she keeps using Explosion to catch fish, which changes the course of the river… and other similar complaints…”</p>

  <p>Megumin covered her ears and turned away. The receptionist kept going anyway.</p>

  <p>“Also, as an adventurer, please stop picking fights with regular people just because they made fun of your name.”</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina sighed. “I’m sorry, but could we just arrest her?”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” the receptionist agreed. “It might be best to get her off the streets for a few days.”</p>

  <p>“Wait! I have reflected on my actions!” Megumin protested. “A-Anyway, the number of people who have a grudge against me is surprisingly huge! Which means the true culprit must be one of them!”</p>

  <p>And with that, Megumin grabbed the throat of an adventurer who happened to step up to the counter beside us.</p>

  <p>“H-Hey!? M-Megumin!? What are you doing!? Cut it out!”</p>

  <p>“You picked a fight with me yesterday, so you’re suspicious in the serial explosions case! Let’s have a nice long chat at the police—ow!”</p>

  <p>I pried Megumin off him, shoved her into a crude bow, then bowed as well.</p>

  <p>“I’m really sorry,” I said. “She’s an idiot. But—can I ask you something? You fought with her yesterday, right? What happened?”</p>

  <p>The adventurer rubbed his neck where she’d grabbed him and shook his head.</p>

  <p>“It wasn’t really a fight. I was reading a notice on the board and bumped into her. I said, ‘Sorry, I was reading and didn’t see you.’ And she goes, ‘So you’re saying I’m a loli!?’ and attacks me.”</p>

  <p>“So you’re just picking fights now!?” I demanded.</p>

  <p>“Ow, ow, ow! N-No! I’m only doing that because adventurers can’t afford to be looked down on—”</p>

  <p>Yeah. We should arrest her.</p>

  <p>“Also,” I said, “this case didn’t start yesterday. So he doesn’t even fit the timeline.”</p>

  <p>“True,” Megumin said immediately. “Then arrest Maribelle. She fought with me last week after comparing her chest size to mine.”</p>

  <p>“I told you not to name random people!” Chief Aloerina snapped. “You’re just listing people you dislike! There is a limit to how shameless you can be!”</p>

  <p>As Megumin and I started bickering again, Aloerina seemed to remember she was an actual police chief. She pulled out a notebook.</p>

  <p>“Megumin, list everyone who might hold a grudge against you. If there are a lot, I’ll have other officers help.”</p>

  <p>Staring Aloerina right in the eye with complete confidence, Megumin began rattling off names.</p>

  <p>“Maribelle, like I said. The weapons shop owner I haggled with until he cried. The magic item shop owner. The grocery seller. And… there are way too many adventurers who might hate me. I can’t list them all.”</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina rubbed her temples. “…Is there really no way we can put her behind bars?”</p>

  <p>“Fine,” Aloerina said. “We aren’t a daycare for problem children, but I suppose we don’t have a choice. Now then, Megumin, we’ll need more details back at the station—”</p>

  <p>“Wait! Please wait… Ah!”</p>

  <p>Megumin, who was one second away from being escorted out, suddenly shouted.</p>

  <p>“I know who the culprit is! You two, follow me!”</p>

  <p><strong>Part 4</strong></p>

  <p>The person Megumin was hunting down turned out to be at the town library.</p>

  <p>Even though there were plenty of empty seats, she was reading at the table in the farthest corner.</p>

  <p>“So this is where you’ve been hiding! Yunyun, there’s no escape!”</p>

  <p>“Eh!? M-Megumin!? What’s going on!?”</p>

  <p>Of course, the culprit Megumin had “deduced” was her self-proclaimed rival and fellow Crimson Demon: Yunyun.</p>

  <p>Megumin shattered the library’s peace, flared her cape, and launched into her usual routine.</p>

  <p>“My name is Megumin! Axel’s most brilliant seeker of truth! Rival Yunyun! Your evil schemes will not escape my blood-red eyes!”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, what are you talking about!? I have no idea what you mean! Evil schemes!?”</p>

  <p>Yunyun sprang to her feet and began bowing and apologizing to the people nearby, who were shooting us looks sharp enough to cut steel.</p>

  <p>I explained quickly. “There’ve been unexplained explosions near town for the past few days.”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, you idiot! It wasn’t enough to do it back in the Crimson Demon Village—now you’re doing it in Axel too!? After causing that huge mess back home, you still haven’t learned!?”</p>

  <p>“Ah!? S-Stop! What are you doing!? Get off me!”</p>

  <p>The moment I said “explosions,” Yunyun latched onto Megumin and started yelling through teary eyes, having apparently invented her own version of the story.</p>

  <p>Then she released Megumin and turned back to us.</p>

  <p>“I’m sorry! Megumin is supposed to be smart, she just never thinks about consequences, but she isn’t a bad person! I’ll go with her to apologize to everyone affected, so please go easy on her—”</p>

  <p>“You too!?” Megumin shouted. “Why does everyone assume I’m guilty after hearing two sentences!?”</p>

  <p>“Ow! That hurts! Stop that!”</p>

  <p>Megumin had grabbed Yunyun by the temples. Watching this, Chief Aloerina put a finger to her chin.</p>

  <p>“Wait. You mentioned something happened in the Crimson Demon Village. Did something similar occur there?”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yes,” Yunyun admitted. “Back then she avoided trouble by blaming it on a devil who happened to be passing by, so I thought she might be doing the same thing again…”</p>

  <p>Hold on. “Blaming it on a devil who happened to be passing by”?</p>

  <p>I was suddenly very curious about Megumin’s backstory.</p>

  <p>“T-Those are different situations!” Megumin sputtered. “No, it really isn’t me this time! Stop looking at me like that… Anyway, Yunyun.”</p>

  <p>Even as Aloerina stared at her suspiciously, Megumin pointed straight at Yunyun.</p>

  <p>“You are suspected of involvement in the serial explosions case. Please come with me to the police station.”</p>

  <p>“Why!?” Yunyun screamed.</p>

  <p>“There is, of course, a reason. First, state your relationship with me.”</p>

  <p>Yunyun blushed and looked back and forth between Megumin and the floor.</p>

  <p>“F-Friends—”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” Megumin cut in. “You are my rival! Isn’t that right!?”</p>

  <p>“T-That’s right! I’m your rival! So what!?”</p>

  <p>“Then you admit it!” Megumin said triumphantly. “Yunyun is my rival. Therefore, she has a motive to harm her rival!”</p>

  <p>“Eh!?”</p>

  <p>Megumin ignored the betrayed look on Yunyun’s face and kept going.</p>

  <p>“Also, you’re second only to me in the Crimson Demon Village! If you want to surpass the genius who can use Explosion, it would be perfectly natural for you to learn a few explosive spells!”</p>

  <p>“What kind of logic is that!? It makes no sense!” Yunyun wailed.</p>

  <p>Megumin regarded her calmly.</p>

  <p>“Then tell me this: were you with anyone when the explosions happened?”</p>

  <p>“…I—I was alone…”</p>

  <p>Megumin smiled like a prosecutor who’d just heard a confession.</p>

  <p>“I see. You were alone. Which means nobody can prove you were inside the city at the time of the explosions, correct?”</p>

  <p>“…Yes.”</p>

  <p>“As you can see,” Megumin said, “she has motive, means, and no alibi. Chief Aloerina, I’ll leave the rest to you.”</p>

  <p>“Then please come with me to the station,” Aloerina said.</p>

  <p>“Wait! It’s not me! I’m innoceeeent!!”</p>

  <p>“…And here I thought for sure it was Yunyun,” Megumin muttered later. “Maybe we were wrong about the whole revenge thing…”</p>

  <p>On our way back from the station, Megumin and I headed out to the outskirts of town.</p>

  <p>“You know,” I said, “isn’t she your friend? Even if you’re rivals, I really doubt someone like her could pull off something that devious.”</p>

  <p>“Do you really think so?” Megumin said. “Pretty much every Crimson Demon I know has cried after trying to compete with me.”</p>

  <p>“…Yeah,” I said. “I still think it’s more likely someone’s trying to get revenge on you.”</p>

  <p>We left town and started searching for Megumin’s explosion target for the day.</p>

  <p>Yes. Even under these circumstances, this idiot insisted on keeping up her daily routine.</p>

  <p>“I really think you should lay off Explosion for a while,” I said.</p>

  <p>“What are you saying? That would mean I lost to the true culprit… No, perhaps that’s their goal! To stop me from casting Explosion…! Could it be the construction crews who fill in my craters every time? But no, they told me they were grateful because it keeps them employed… Ah! Could it be the Demon King’s army, afraid of my power?”</p>

  <p>Listening to her mumble absolute nonsense, I struggled to believe this girl was supposed to be “highly intelligent.”</p>

  <p>“All right, this spot is fine,” I said. “It’s freezing today. Just do it here and let’s go home.”</p>

  <p>“There isn’t much snow here,” Megumin complained. “We should pick a place where it’s deeper. It’ll look amazing to leave my mark in deep snow with my Explosion.”</p>

  <p>“…So it’s like how the snow melts when I pee on it.”</p>

  <p>“Of course not! Don’t compare the great art of the Crimson Demons to your vulgar bodily functions!”</p>

  <p>While fending off her tantrum, we reached the edge of the forest.</p>

  <p>“If I fire off Explosion inside the forest, the woodcutters’ and hunters’ guilds will get mad. So we’ll do it around here.”</p>

  <p>“Why is your life so bitter?” I asked. “Do you have to make an enemy every day? Can’t you live a more peaceful life?”</p>

  <p>“I walk the path of explosions. I do not care for peace. Now—behold my power!”</p>

  <p>Megumin began chanting in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>“Explosion!!!”</p>

  <p>A giant fireball erupted in a clearing beside the forest.</p>

  <p>At the same time, I heard a different boom from somewhere far away.</p>

  <p><strong>Part 5</strong></p>

  <p>The next day.</p>

  <p>“Therefore, we request that Megumin stop casting Explosion for the time being. You may not be the culprit, but if we can’t investigate in peace—”</p>

  <p>“I refuse.”</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina had come by again and was currently trying to reason with Megumin.</p>

  <p>Of course, while we were out of town yesterday, a large explosion had been reported near the forest.</p>

  <p>At this point, it was pretty clear: whoever the culprit was, they set off their own explosion at the same time Megumin did.</p>

  <p>I’d been with Megumin yesterday, so I could vouch for her innocence. It didn’t matter. The police still ordered her to stop casting Explosion until the case was resolved.</p>

  <p>“You might as well be asking me to die!” Megumin said. “Crimson Demons overflow with magical energy. If we don’t regularly release excess mana with spells, we’ll die. In fact, if I don’t cast Explosion every day, my mana could go out of control and destroy this town.”</p>

  <p>“There is a limit to the lies you can tell,” Aloerina shot back. “If that were true, Crimson Demons would’ve gone extinct before learning magic.”</p>

  <p>Megumin turned toward me like she was about to make me her witness… and that’s when an announcement boomed through town.</p>

  <p>“Emergency quest! Emergency quest! All adventurers, report to the adventurers’ guild immediately!”</p>

  <p>The announcement cut her off.</p>

  <p>By the time we’d grabbed our gear and reached the guild, Luna was addressing a crowd of adventurers with a desperate expression.</p>

  <p>“Adventurers, thank you for coming. Here’s the situation: a group of one-punch bears has woken early from hibernation and wandered close to town. There are more than ten. The few crops left in the fields won’t satisfy them, so they’ll likely head into town in search of food. Arm yourselves and prepare to intercept!”</p>

  <p>One-punch bears were exactly what the name implied: monsters with claws strong enough to crush you in a single blow. Even veteran adventurers could get killed if they got unlucky.</p>

  <p>If a whole group hit the town…</p>

  <p>“A group of one-punch bears… how could this be!?” Aloerina went pale. “This town is full of newbie adventurers! If you fight them head-on, there will be casualties!”</p>

  <p>The adventurers heard that and immediately started talking over her.</p>

  <p>“As you said, there may be sacrifices. But laying down our lives for the peace of this town is an adventurer’s duty.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah! That’s why we became adventurers. We’ve accepted we might die someday. Right, everyone!?”</p>

  <p>“Yup! Miss, just wait here. If we survive, we’ll grab drinks together!”</p>

  <p>“They’re just bears! I won’t let a single one step into town!”</p>

  <p>Aloerina looked at them in awe… and then realized what they were actually doing.</p>

  <p>They were all staring confidently at someone next to me.</p>

  <p>Megumin.</p>

  <p>“You all seem pretty fired up,” Megumin said. “Guess there’s no need for me to interfere today.”</p>

  <p>“Eh!?” x10</p>

  <p>The adventurers froze. Megumin was the type to sprint for the spotlight, and she’d just… declined it.</p>

  <p>“No, no,” someone pleaded. “Megumin, this is exactly when you should step in! We might manage, but there will definitely be casualties without you. But if you do your thing…”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yeah! We’ll fight, but you’ll wipe them out instantly!”</p>

  <p>“One-punch bears can’t hold a candle to you! You’re known as the one strike archmage, after all! Right!?”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, this is your stage! I want to see your cool side!”</p>

  <p>In other words: everyone here had been brave because they assumed Megumin’s Explosion would solve everything.</p>

  <p>“There are plenty of adventurers here,” Aqua said with a yawn. “Looks like you won’t need me either. Kazuma, I don’t want the fire at home to go out, so I’m heading back to tend it. See you later.”</p>

  <p>“Eh!?” x10</p>

  <p>Aqua walked right out, leaving the adventurers frozen a second time.</p>

  <p>Getting yanked away from her fireplace nap had apparently put her in the worst mood imaginable.</p>

  <p>The adventurers who’d been counting on Aqua’s resurrection magic started turning pale.</p>

  <p>Then Megumin, smiling sweetly, addressed the room.</p>

  <p>“Also, Chief Aloerina here suspects me in the serial explosions case, so I’ve been forbidden from casting Explosion. I’d love to use my spell on a worthy target for once, but it’s a pity.”</p>

  <p>“W-Wait!?” Aloerina squeaked.</p>

  <p>Every adventurer in the room slowly turned to stare at the chief.</p>

  <p>“E-Er…” Aloerina wilted under the pressure. “Megumin… it’s an emergency, so we’ll temporarily lift the restriction on casting Explosion.”</p>

  <p>Megumin shrugged.</p>

  <p>“Only temporarily? So after I risk my life to repel the bears, you’ll ban me again? Hearing that just drains my motivation…”</p>

  <p>“Aaaah, fine!” Aloerina shouted. “The ban is rescinded! Please participate in this quest!”</p>

  <p><strong>Part 6</strong></p>

  <p>On the snowy plains, a group of bears let out a thunderous roar.</p>

  <p>And standing across from them was the self-proclaimed strongest archmage in town.</p>

  <p>The other adventurers (me included) took positions behind Megumin to deal with anything that somehow survived.</p>

  <p>Megumin raised her staff and began to chant.</p>

  <p>I’d heard her spell enough times to notice instantly: she was drawing it out on purpose.</p>

  <p>She was putting on a performance for her audience.</p>

  <p>When she finished, Megumin lifted her staff proudly.</p>

  <p>“Behold my power! Explosion!”</p>

  <p>A sphere of light shot into the cluster of one-punch bears and detonated.</p>

  <p>When the smoke cleared, a giant crater was all that remained.</p>

  <p>The adventurers erupted into cheers as Megumin collapsed from mana exhaustion.</p>

  <p>“A-Amazing… so this is Explosion magic…”</p>

  <p>Chief Aloerina—who was seeing it up close for the first time—said it with honest awe.</p>

  <p>She’d come along to help if needed, but the spell’s raw power clearly rattled her.</p>

  <p>Megumin looked thrilled. As I helped her back up, she asked with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>“That is my Explosion magic… so? What do you think? Did the other ‘serial explosions’ leave craters this big?”</p>

  <p>Aloerina closed her eyes and slowly shook her head.</p>

  <p>“…No. None of the previous incidents left a crater anywhere near this large… Megumin.”</p>

  <p>Then she looked Megumin in the eye.</p>

  <p>“I’m truly sorry I suspected you. Once again, I apologize.”</p>

  <p>She bowed deeply.</p>

  <p>That finally seemed to wipe away any lingering suspicion she had left.</p>

  <p>“Haha. As long as you understand. I’m happy enough to be cleared. And I’m in a good mood after taking care of those bears, so I’ll forgive you.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Megumin’s words, Aloerina smiled.</p>

  <p>“I-I’m, err, sorry for suspecting you too! Yeah, Megumin isn’t the kind of person who constantly seeks out trouble. I’ll bring nice snacks to your house next time as an apology…”</p>

  <p>“Haha, it’s a small matter. You don’t need to go that far. Yunyun, you should learn from Kazuma and trust me a little more. And Kazuma…”</p>

  <p>Megumin turned to me, suddenly a little shy.</p>

  <p>“Thank you for believing in me.”</p>

  <p>She said it with a wide smile.</p>

  <p>Right then—</p>

  <p>“What happened here!? Hey, Kazuma—what happened while I was gone!?”</p>

  <p>Darkness appeared from the mountains with a small group of soldiers and shouted when she saw the crater.</p>

  <p>They were probably guards employed by the Dustiness family.</p>

  <p>“Where did you go?” I asked. “There was an emergency quest—one-punch bears woke up early. If it weren’t for Megumin, this would’ve been a disaster.”</p>

  <p>“I-Is that so!? Hmm… They must’ve been woken up by the serial explosions. There was one in the forest yesterday too, so they probably woke up around then.”</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, the serial explosions case we’d been chasing this whole time still hadn’t actually been resolved.</p>

  <p>“So this is that explosion maniac’s fault too? Fine! I’ll resolve this case tomorrow! You’ll all witness the high intelligence of the Crimson Demons firsthand!”</p>

  <p>Even though I’d been carrying her a second ago, Megumin sprang to her feet like nothing was wrong. Darkness just smiled.</p>

  <p>“Ah… about that, Megumin. The culprit has already been found.”</p>

  <p>At that, one of the armored men beside Darkness pulled a small mushroom from his bag.</p>

  <p>“This is called a mine mushroom. Under certain conditions, it explodes violently. They’re fairly common around mountain paths. We’ll have people gather them and dispose of them properly. And it looks like quite a few are growing in the forest too, so we’ll deal with those as well.”</p>

  <p>All of us let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>“So this is what caused all that chaos,” I muttered. “Why did we go through all that trouble…?”</p>

  <p>“Seriously. I ended up suspecting a lot of people because of those mushrooms,” Megumin said. “I’ll use Explosion to take care of them all at once. Darkness, gather them for me, and I’ll dispose of them once they’re piled up.”</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Darkness averted her gaze.</p>

  <p>“That’s, um… I really don’t recommend letting Megumin handle disposal. We’ll take care of it properly, so…”</p>

  <p>Darkness’s reaction gave me a very bad feeling.</p>

  <p>“…Hey. You said they explode under certain conditions, right? So what are the conditions?”</p>

  <p>After a brief silence, Darkness said,</p>

  <p>“They explode in the presence of strong magic.”</p>

  <p>Megumin quickly looked away.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>“…Wait. So if someone cast Explosion next to a forest where a bunch of these mushrooms were growing…”</p>

  <p>“They will explode.”</p>

  <p>“…And if someone cast Explosion near the mountains…”</p>

  <p>“Of course they’ll explode.”</p>

  <p>Hey.</p>

  <p>“…N-No, wait, that’s not…”</p>

  <p>Megumin broke out in a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>I wondered what, exactly, she thought she was going to say next.</p>

  <p>Aloerina pulled out a set of handcuffs, and Megumin shouted,</p>

  <p>“Oh, okay, fine! When you think ‘explosion,’ you think of me! When you think of me, you think of explosions! Fine! Blame me next time too! But if you’re going to accuse someone, you should produce evidence first—”</p>

  <p>“What good does it do to say such things now!? I was a fool to believe you in the first place!”</p>
