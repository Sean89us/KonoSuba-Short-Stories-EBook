  <p>It was an unbearably hot, muggy night.</p>

  <p>“Just when I thought I’d finally gotten away, something landed right on top of my head. I looked up…”</p>

  <p>The adventurers who couldn’t sleep in this heat were huddled together in the back of the guild tavern.</p>

  <p>“And saw a large swarm of cellar spiders crawling on the ceiling above me!”</p>

  <p>“WAAAAAH!”</p>

  <p>We’d asked the staff to dim the tavern lights and started trading ghost stories in the gloom.</p>

  <p>If it were just me, I could get through a night like this by using Freeze.</p>

  <p>But most adventurers don’t have that option, and the heat had been making the last few nights miserable.</p>

  <p>Partly out of sympathy—and partly to kill time—I gathered them here to cool off with some horror stories.</p>

  <p>However…</p>

  <p>“U-Um, it’s scary and all, but it feels kind of different from what I had in mind…”</p>

  <p>The adventurer was recounting a dungeon run, but… how should I put it? It was more physically disgusting than scary.</p>

  <p>“What are you saying, Kazuma? Those are cellar spiders, you know? The little ones that scuttle everywhere and drop onto you if you let your guard down for even a moment! There aren’t many things scarier than that…”</p>

  <p>“Please stop, Aqua! It’s reminding me of the last time I went into a dungeon…”</p>

  <p>One of the female adventurers screamed at Aqua’s elaboration.</p>

  <p>“Then let me tell you a special horror story of mine. This happened on my tenth birthday…”</p>

  <p>Megumin’s red eyes were clearly visible in the dimness of the tavern.</p>

  <p>The adventurers gulped in response.</p>

  <p>“My family is poor, so food is often scarce. So on my tenth birthday, I wasn’t expecting much… but my little sister gave me a present.”</p>

  <p>Isn’t that a good thing?</p>

  <p>Judging by the way the tension eased, I wasn’t the only one thinking that.</p>

  <p>Megumin looked around at us and continued.</p>

  <p>“The present… She must have worked really hard to gather it all for me. Her face was caked with mud when she ran up beaming and said, ’Big Sis, I caught a bunch of big, black ones!‘ and handed me a wriggling bag—”</p>

  <p>“WAAAAAH!”</p>

  <p>The adventurers once again broke out into screams.</p>

  <p>No, this isn’t right at all.</p>

  <p>“Knock it off! This isn’t the kind of story I wanted to hear! These aren’t horror stories at all!”</p>

  <p>For some inexplicable reason, Darkness started blushing after hearing that.</p>

  <p>“T-Then… I’ll go next… I have a story where a mysterious girl’s screams could be heard coming from the basement of a certain noble’s mansion every night…”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, and then when you investigate, it turns out the noble is sneaking off to meet a maid every night, right? …Hey, don’t just go silent on me. We’re asking for horror stories, not erotic ones.”</p>

  <p>After I said that to Darkness, another adventurer said,</p>

  <p>“Then, how about you share a story, Kazuma? You must have some great ones, right?”</p>

  <p>Sure. I cleared my throat and launched into a classic Japanese horror story—</p>

  <p>“—I see. Anyone who sees a picture of that woman dies within a week. So it’s like a death premonition? But with Aqua around, wouldn’t that be an easy fix? Compared to her, that absurdly skilled dullahan is way scarier.”</p>

  <p>“Also, about that Sadako ghost—how would you communicate with her without that ’telephone’ magic item Kazuma mentioned? Doesn’t she only show up if someone is already using it? And if she’s suddenly appearing from behind, is she using Lurk to sneak up on them? Wouldn’t that just make her a burglar who targets people rich enough to afford the thing?”</p>

  <p>…Damn it. This is why I hate this world.</p>

  <p>It’s just a horror story—why are you nitpicking it this much?</p>

  <p>Was there really no way to make these people feel genuine fear?</p>

  <p>For once, Aqua read the room and gave me a thumbs-up like she was saying, “Leave it to me.”</p>

  <p>“Then I’ll go next. This one will definitely be terrifying for men.”</p>

  <p>All the adventurers seemed to relax at Aqua’s declaration. They were probably thinking, ’It’s just one of Aqua’s stories—how scary could it be?’</p>

  <p>“In some city, there’s a man who lives alone. He’s constantly pestered by door-to-door salesmen, until he comes up with a brilliant idea to scare them off.”</p>

  <p>He put a sign up on his front door.</p>

  <p>After that, the salesmen stopped bothering him, and he was able to live in peace.</p>

  <p>“However, one day, the man heard a knock and wondered if he was imagining it. After all, this is what he’d written on the sign.”</p>

  <p>Growing curious in response to Aqua’s words, we unconsciously let out a gulp.</p>

  <p>“The sign said: ’The resident of this house is a hardcore gay man. If you’re prepared for what comes next, feel free to knock.‘ The man peeked out through the door, and standing there was… an obviously excited man, a leering smile on his face as he placed a hand on the door—”</p>

  <p>“WAAAAAAAAAAAH!”</p>

  <p>The male adventurers interrupted Aqua with a scream.</p>

  <p>—Stop! Sure, it’s scary, but these aren’t horror stories!</p>
