  <p>There’s a monster known as the Rookie Killer.</p>

  <p>These creatures are covered in black fur, have golden, catlike eyes, and sport the long fangs and claws that mark them as carnivores. They’re fierce, cunning monsters, and they’re said to be highly intelligent.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the cage that held one, Megumin grabbed the bars with both hands and murmured,</p>

  <p>“So cool….”</p>

  </p>

  <p>Behind the guild was a row of iron cages used to hold monsters captured for research or trade.</p>

  <p>Not many people came back here, given the risk of keeping live monsters in captivity, but for some reason, Megumin’s eyes sparkled like a kid at a zoo, and she refused to leave the Rookie Killer’s cage.</p>

  <p>“Hey, even if it’s a so-called herbivorous Rookie Killer, it’s still a powerful monster. Come on, it’s dangerous here, so let’s go back.”</p>

  <p>Yes, this Rookie Killer is said to be the rare herbivorous type.</p>

  <p>Apparently, after hearing rumors it existed, the guild had even called in adventurers from far away to capture such a rare specimen.</p>

  <p>Rookie Killers normally have yellow eyes, but this one’s were red, just like Megumin’s. That combination of red and black apparently spoke to her Crimson Demon sense of aesthetics, and she’d stood in front of the cage for a full hour.</p>

  <p>“Do you not understand how cool he is, Kazuma? That sleek body, those huge fangs that look like they could drop something in a single bite, and those bright red eyes shining from under his black fur… Everything about him is cool!”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, big cats are cool and all, but a noble’s already decided to buy this Rookie Killer. We can’t afford the compensation if anything happens to him.”</p>

  <p>“Just a little longer… I’ll go back in a bit. He really seems to like wolfberries. Yeah, I like them too.”</p>

  <p>Megumin said, gazing at the Rookie Killer as it hungrily chowed down on the fruit in its cage. How many times had she said “just a little longer” by now?</p>

  <p>And just like that, she spent the entire day in front of the cage, only heading back when it got too dark to see it clearly.</p>

  <p>—I had no idea what made her so obsessed, but she came back to visit the Rookie Killer again the next day.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, I want to introduce the Rookie Killer to Chomusuke.”</p>

  <p>“…I know they’re both cats, but have you really thought this through? At least consider the size difference… Hey, stop! Don’t shove Chomusuke through the bars! Do you want her to become a snack?”</p>

  <p>After Megumin shoved Chomusuke through the bars, the cat didn’t run away—instead, she casually walked up to the Rookie Killer and started sniffing it.</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer didn’t seem to care, simply lying in its cage as Chomusuke approached.</p>

  <p>“…Looks like it didn’t work. And here I was hoping they’d have a cool baby together…”</p>

  <p>“Come on, you should respect their choice.”</p>

  <p>From that day on, Megumin visited the Rookie Killer daily.</p>

  <p>“I want to give him an awesome-sounding name.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t do that. Seriously, I’m begging you, don’t.”</p>

  <p>“-I made an outfit to make Chomusuke look even cuter today. Do you think the Rookie Killer will like her better now?”</p>

  <p>“What are you doing? I feel sorry for Chomusuke… Though I guess the cat quite likes it…”</p>

  <p>And thus, the days went by. Then, one day-</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, Kazuma, I think something’s been wrong with the Rookie Killer lately. How do I put it… It feels weaker than usual.”</p>

  <p>“…Yeah, it does seem more lethargic. And the way it’s sleeping is a little odd.”</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer lay in the middle of its cage, its eyes half open.</p>

  <p>“Maybe he’s gotten weak from being locked up in that cage for so long.”</p>

  <p>After we reported it to the guild staff, they tried all sorts of things—changing its diet, inviting priests to cast Heal on it—but none of it seemed to make much difference.</p>

  <p>Worried, Megumin gripped the bars and pressed her face right up to the cage.</p>

  <p>I told her that it’s still dangerous even if it’s herbivorous, but she completely ignored me. Until the day the noble arrived, Megumin spent all her time glued to that cage.</p>

  <p>“-So this is the herbivorous Rookie Killer… What the—It’s not dead, is it?!”</p>

  <p>Such were the words the noble uttered upon seeing the Rookie Killer.</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer had only grown weaker and weaker, and now it lay motionless in the middle of the cage.</p>

  <p>According to Megumin, the only times it gets up from that spot nowadays is for meals. It’s otherwise completely listless.</p>

  <p>“It isn’t dead. Can’t you see its ears moving?”</p>

  <p>Megumin, who was still glued to the cage, immediately retorted.</p>

  <p>“Who are you? Are you the adventurer who caught this beast?”</p>

  <p>“No, I’m only here to visit.”</p>

  <p>The nobleman waved dismissively at Megumin to shoo her away, then ordered his men to bring the cage outside.</p>

  <p>Even as it was hauled along the streets, the Rookie Killer remained motionless. The nobleman prodded it with his cane to check for signs of life.</p>

  <p>Seeing the Rookie Killer remain completely still, the man let out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>“It might not make it back to my residence like this… Ah well. If it dies, I suppose I’ll just have it stuffed.”</p>

  <p>Those words put an indignant expression on Megumin’s face.</p>

  <p>“…How long do you intend to follow us? Anyway, we’re leaving, so make way.”</p>

  <p>The nobleman said as they struggled to lift the cage onto the carriage they had waiting outside the town’s walls.</p>

  <p>“…Hey, how long is this going to take? Never mind. We brought the specially made collar, yes? Put it on its neck and take it out of the cage. If it’s this weak, a collar and rope will be enough to control it. It’ll be faster this way—and I won’t have to pay for the cage.”</p>

  <p>Hearing the nobleman’s words, his underlings gave each other a look, before doing as ordered.</p>

  <p>“All right, the collar and rope are on… Are you sure this thing is still alive? It’s not moving at all. Hey, drag it out of the cage!”</p>

  <p>Following his instructions, his men grabbed the rope and dragged the Rookie Killer out of the cage. And then—</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer suddenly opened its eyes, and pounced upon the nobleman.</p>

  <p>“Aaah! Th-This thing isn’t weak at all! Help me! Hey, Crimson Demon girl! You can use advanced magic, right? Hurry up and kill it!”</p>

  <p>Megumin brought out her staff and struck a pose.</p>

  <p>We were adventurers, after all. No matter how much she liked that Rookie Killer—or how much she disliked the nobleman—we couldn’t exactly ignore someone getting mauled by a monster.</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer stared at Megumin and slowly backed away from the nobleman.</p>

  <p>Without taking its eyes off Megumin, it began edging away from the town.</p>

  <p>It must have instinctively known she was the only one here who posed a real threat.</p>

  <p>“Hurry up! What are you waiting for, strike it down already!”</p>

  <p>The newly freed nobleman screamed, and Megumin said,</p>

  <p>“My magic is quite special. If I unleash it at this range, it might hurt you…”</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry about that, hurry up and blast it! That thing tried to kill me, so hurry up and slay it already!”</p>

  <p>Now that she has gotten an excuse, Megumin smiled.</p>

  <p>“Explosion—!”</p>

  <p>The blast went off some distance away from the Rookie Killer, only buffeting it with the shockwave and doing no major damage. On the other hand, since they were much closer, the nobleman and his underlings all passed out from the shock.</p>

  <p>The Rookie Killer glanced at Megumin, who collapsed after expending her mana—</p>

  <p>“…It left… Yeah. Rookie Killers are cunning, highly intelligent monsters. I almost forgot…”</p>

  <p>“…”</p>

  <p>“…Say, there’s a reason other than mana exhaustion that you won’t lift your head, right?”</p>

  <p>“Shut up! You’re as tactless as ever, Kazuma! Forget it—hurry up and carry me home!”</p>

  <p>—A few days later, I heard the police discovered a huge pile of wolfberries mysteriously left outside the gates…</p>
