  <hr/>

  <p>“Hey, Dust. Can I ask you something?”</p>

  <p>Lynn called out to me over dinner at our usual table in the guild hall.</p>

  <p>“If you’re going to ask me what my type is, I ain’t answering.”</p>

  <p>“Not that. Don’t you think Keith and Taylor have been acting kind of weird lately?”</p>

  <p>Here I was, worried about what had her frowning so hard. So it was them.</p>

  <p>I hadn’t noticed anything.</p>

  <p>“Weird how?”</p>

  <p>“You hang out with Keith a lot. Has he been doing anything shady? The other day, when I called out to both of you, he panicked.”</p>

  <p>“Did that happen? …I don’t remember.”</p>

  <p>The only thing that comes to mind is… that time we ran into Lynn on our way back from the Succubus Shop.</p>

  <p>That place is a secret known only to male adventurers. Even if it’s Lynn, there’s no way we can let her find out.</p>

  <p>“Plus, he drinks every day. But lately, even when he has money, there are times when he doesn’t. Same goes for you.”</p>

  <p>Yeah, because we were saving up for the best dreams money can buy.</p>

  <p>“We, uh… realized the value of having a healthy body. You’ve got to take a break now and then and let your liver rest, right?”</p>

  <p>“…”</p>

  <p>Don’t just stare at me like that. Say something.</p>

  <p>She didn’t believe me for a second. Honestly, I don’t blame her. It was a terrible lie.</p>

  <p>“Fine. I’ll ask you for the details later. The real problem is Taylor.”</p>

  <p>“He doesn’t really come out with us.”</p>

  <p>We kept the Succubus Shop a secret from Taylor.</p>

  <p>He’s stubborn in that uptight way, and I could easily see him lecturing us instead of using it himself.</p>

  <p>“I’d worry less if he was with you. But every now and then, Taylor meets someone in secret. A friend told me he keeps going to a high-class bar—with someone.”</p>

  <p>“Wait, what? He has a girl?! Unforgivable!”</p>

  <p>And here I thought he had no luck with women! That traitor!</p>

  <p>…Still, I couldn’t remember him ever showing signs of that.</p>

  <p>“That’s the thing. It’s not a girl. He’s meeting with a man.”</p>

  <p>“Then it’s just a friend, right? Leave it alone. It’s not our business. As long as he’s not doing something illegal, don’t pry.”</p>

  <p>“And who was the one who stuck their nose in when that noble asked me for advice?”</p>

  <p>“Friends are important. Let’s keep an eye on him. What if he’s getting mixed up with some unsavory people?!”</p>

  <p>Lynn narrowed her eyes even further as I boldly proclaimed that.</p>

  <p>I got dragged into an absolute nightmare last time I roped Kazuma into helping me with photos, so this time, we’d watch from a safe distance.</p>

  <p>Two days later.</p>

  <p>After a quest, Keith invited everyone to cool off at the bar, but Taylor refused.</p>

  <p>“Sorry. I’ve got plans with someone.”</p>

  <p>With that, he left the guild without even eating dinner.</p>

  <p>Lynn and I turned Keith down too, then followed Taylor.</p>

  <p>At the fancy bar Lynn had heard about, Taylor walked in without even glancing around.</p>

  <p>Lynn and I went in after him with our hoods pulled low.</p>

  <p>The place was way classier than the guild hall. We spotted Taylor and took the seats behind him.</p>

  <p>“This really looks like a date with a woman.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t think so. The person sitting across from Taylor is definitely a guy. I saw him when we sat down. I just couldn’t make out his face…”</p>

  <p>Lynn and I whispered as we settled in.</p>

  <p>“Sorry I’m late.”</p>

  <p>“No worries. I just got here myself.”</p>

  <p>I’d heard that voice before.</p>

  <p>It was a little muffled from where I sat, so I couldn’t be sure, but… that voice…</p>

  <p>“How was your day?”</p>

  <p>“No major issues. Keith and Dust don’t have any problems when it comes to ability, and Lynn’s always reliable.”</p>

  <p>Lynn, clearly thrilled at the praise, jabbed me in the side with her elbow.</p>

  <p>“Ugh, I’m jealous. Mine was absolutely horrible. The ones on my side don’t listen to a word I say.”</p>

  <p>“I-I see. I’ve never teamed up with them, so I don’t know firsthand what you’re dealing with, but… Dust has told me plenty.”</p>

  <p>Yeah. The guy Taylor was talking to was definitely Kazuma.</p>

  <p>“That’s Kazuma, right? I didn’t know they were that close. Do you think they feel some kind of kinship from being party leaders?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe. Still, there’s no reason they’d need to keep this secret.”</p>

  <p>Two guys grabbing a drink together isn’t exactly scandalous.</p>

  <p>And here I was expecting something way worse.</p>

  <p>…Of course, the moment I thought that, they started complaining nonstop about their party members.</p>

  <p>Kazuma had plenty of complaints, and honestly, I agreed with most of them. Taylor didn’t seem to have any complaints about Lynn, but…</p>

  <p>“Aren’t most of his complaints about me?”</p>

  <p>“He’s not wrong… Oh, I get it. They’re sneaking around because they don’t want their parties to find out they’re venting.”</p>

  <p>…Let’s just go home.</p>
