 <p>That day.</p>

 <p>Ever since coming to this world, I’d been waiting for the kind of rom-com moment you only see in anime.</p>

 <p>“Hyaaa!?”</p>

 <p>Darkness stood there, naked, right in front of me.</p>

 <p>Yes—this was the so-called “lucky pervert scenario”.</p>

 <p>“Hey, why didn’t you lock the door? And just so we’re clear, I’m not at fault here. There’s no reason to knock before entering the bathroom during the day.”</p>

 <p>I’d woken up early and headed to the bathroom to rinse off, only to walk in on Darkness as she was undressing.</p>

 <p>We’ve lived in the same house for over a year. Stuff like that happens.</p>

 <p>Seeing how calm I was, Darkness froze, dumbfounded.</p>

 <p>“T-T-Turn around! And don’t act like it’s no big deal! I told everyone the bathroom lock is broken! And even if it was an accident, a man has to apologize for seeing a maiden’s bare skin!”</p>

 <p>“Nice try, but that warped logic isn’t going to work on me! People who love yelling about equality always expect men to back down when it doesn’t go their way! If I ever rack up enough merits to earn a title, I’m abolishing this stupid system—starting in this house.”</p>

 <p>“I get it, I get it! I have way too much to argue with, so just turn around first!”</p>

 <p>Darkness finally gave in to my flawless argument and answered with a teary face.</p>

 <p>Having been judged innocent, I turned away in relief.</p>

 <p>“We already bathed together once. Why are you still so shy? And you took very good care of me at that certain shop.”</p>

 <p>“You’re still bringing that up…!? And what do you mean, ’that shop’?”</p>

 <p>“That shop is that shop. One you’ll be better off not knowing about. Anyway, are you done? I woke up covered in sweat, so I want a quick bath.”</p>

 <p>That line hit Darkness hard.</p>

 <p>“Y-You really have no reaction after seeing me naked… And you’re worried about your sweat at a time like this!?”</p>

 <p>“Your naked body doesn’t rattle me anymore. If you understand, get dressed and get out.”</p>

 <p>Darkness complained as she hurriedly dressed.</p>

 <p>After washing up, I cast Freeze on myself in the living room to cool down. Darkness glared at me.</p>

 <p>“…What, you want Freeze too?”</p>

 <p>“No! I’m mad that you don’t even care after seeing me naked! You saw a woman’s bare body—don’t you think your attitude is awful?”</p>

 <p>“You’re really a pain… Sure, it’s partly my fault for forgetting the lock was broken. But I’d really appreciate it if you could decide whether you want me interested or not interested in your naked body.”</p>

 <p>“…Ideally, you’d be very interested… but I don’t want you to look.”</p>

 <p>What a troublesome woman.</p>

 <p>“If it were Aqua, she’d forget after one bottle of expensive wine. Megumin probably wouldn’t care at all.”</p>

 <p>“That’s because they’re abnormal! If you feel any guilt at all, I’ll forgive you if you apologize. I don’t need wine like Aqua—just do something to make it up to me.”</p>

 <p>Darkness circled around it, the way nobles always did.</p>

 <p>“Make it up to you… You mean insult you or kick you in public? I’m a normal guy without those fetishes, so I can’t act that out for you…”</p>

 <p>“Idiot, not that! There are plenty of normal things you can do—like giving me something I like, or taking me to a restaurant with a nice atmosphere.”</p>

 <p>Gifts, and taking her out…</p>

 <p>“If it’s something you like, there aren’t any pet shops here, so no collars. And as for restaurants… I pretty much only go to the barbecue place.”</p>

 <p>“…At a time like this, I’d like you to set my fetishes aside and do something normal. As for restaurants, places commoners go to are… refreshing, but I’d prefer somewhere that takes reservations, or maybe somewhere members-only.”</p>

 <p>This girl was troublesome in many ways.</p>

 <p>Her fetish and her personality were both troublesome.</p>

 <p>“Go pick out a gift as an apology! If you see a maiden’s bare skin, you have to pay the appropriate price…!”</p>

 <p>Darkness was all smiles, probably getting cocky because I looked like I was actually considering it.</p>

 <p>Her smug face when she had the upper hand was irritating, too.</p>

 <p>… I couldn’t be bothered to think anymore.</p>

 <p>“Fine. I’ll let you see me naked and we’ll call it even. Problem solved.”</p>

 <p>“How is that a solution!? Who would want to see that—hey, don’t take your pants off! Stop! I-I get it, forget it! S-Stop… Hyaaahh!”</p>

 <p>It’d been a while since I’d heard Darkness squeal like that.</p>
