  <p>“My rival Yunyun! Today, we shall finally settle our score!”</p>

  <p>“I wouldn’t have it any other way, Megumin! We shall finally put an end to this long battle of ours and fulfill the long-standing dream of our clan!”</p>

  <p>With their eyes glowing red, the two Crimson Demons stared each other down as the crowd cheered around them.</p>

  <p>With the tension peaking, the two of them nodded and…</p>

  <p>This happened on the rare day I woke up early.</p>

  <p>I roped Aqua—who was as free as I was—into a round of cards.</p>

  <p>“My name is Megumin! Wielder of Explosion magic and the number one mage in Axel!”</p>

  <p>What is it with kids these days and their blood pressure? Ignoring how early it was, an extremely hyped-up Megumin loudly introduced herself in the living room.</p>

  <p>“My turn. I sacrifice Snow Sprite to summon Winter Shogun. You die instantly.”</p>

  <p>“…Hold on, how did I just lose without taking a turn?”</p>

  <p>Ignoring Megumin, who was standing there waiting for someone to react to the pose she’d struck, I gathered the cards and started shuffling for the next round.</p>

  <p>Darkness, who was enjoying a cup of tea after breakfast, looked unsure whether she should humor Megumin’s frozen pose.</p>

  <p>In the end, Darkness decided not to ruin the peaceful morning and went back to the documents she was poring over…</p>

  <p>“My name is Megumin! Wielder of Explosion magic and the number one mage in Axel!”</p>

  <p>Megumin once again repeated her declaration as if she didn’t just say it a few moments ago.</p>

  <p>“Oh, I finally got lucky! This looks like it’ll be an easy win for me. I summon the Loli Succubus. She might be weak, but her special ability means male monsters can’t attack her!”</p>

  <p>“My turn. I summon Axel’s famous Giant Toad. Any small-sized monster that isn’t wearing metal armor gets swallowed and dies.”</p>

  <p>The moment Aqua smugly put down her card, it was instantly killed…</p>

  <p>“Graaah!”</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! What are you doing!? I finally got blessed with a good hand!”</p>

  <p>Megumin suddenly went berserk, threw herself onto the table, and sent the cards flying.</p>

  <p>“What’s your problem? Yeah, yeah, your form is really cool today, so hurry out and show the neighborhood kids how cool your pose is!”</p>

  <p>While I picked up the scattered cards, Megumin—still sprawled across the table—raised her head toward me and said,</p>

  <p>“What’s with the halfhearted compliment!? Of course the pose I chose is cool. I didn’t need you to tell me that. More importantly: why I’m making a point of introducing myself like this now.”</p>

  <p>Now?</p>

  <p>“Don’t you announce your name for no reason all the time? I always assumed it was some kind of Crimson Demon illness.”</p>

  <p>“I figured you had some weird illness too, so I’ve been quietly casting Heal on you now and then.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t treat me like some sort of mental patient! Anyway, you’re missing the point—the important part is the ’number one mage in Axel’ bit. This might be a beginner town, but even I know there are plenty of strong spellcasters besides me.”</p>

  <p>After finally getting off the table, Megumin said something almost admirable for once.</p>

  <p>“Oh, so you finally learned humility. So, are you going to stop calling yourself the number one mage of Axel or whatever and start using a humbler title instead?”</p>

  <p>“Not at all. I plan to challenge the strongest people in Axel to duels and be acknowledged as the true strongest mage in this town.”</p>

  <p>…This girl’s up to something troublesome again.</p>

  <p>Darkness, who’d been quietly watching from the side until now, tore her gaze away from her paperwork.</p>

  <p>“Hey, Megumin, it’s fine to challenge people, but now’s a bad time. There’s been a string of attacks on magic users lately. Even when the victims are questioned, they just say things like ’I fell while I was walking’ and refuse to press charges. There’s definitely some big criminal organization behind it, so please behave until this is resolved-”</p>

  <p>“Ah, that criminal organization is me! Recently, I’ve been challenging the mages in town to duels, and I’ve won every single one of them.”</p>

  <p>The second you take your eyes off her…</p>

  <p>Everyone was probably keeping quiet because they didn’t want anyone to know they’d lost to the mage famous for being useless—and a younger girl, on top of that.</p>

  <p>Darkness gazed deeply into the leaves at the bottom of her teacup.</p>

  <p>“I’ve been staying up late every night looking into this matter for…”</p>

  <p>She sounded a little like she wanted to cry. I couldn’t help but feel sorry for her.</p>

  <p>“Still, isn’t that kind of impressive? I wouldn’t expect Megumin to beat everyone in a magic duel when she only knows Explosion.”</p>

  <p>“No, I just used my head a little. If I used Explosion in town, I’d be branded a criminal. So I flipped it around: I challenged them on the main streets, where no one can use magic, and beat them with my level and strength advantage.”</p>

  <p>What the hell is she doing?</p>

  <p>“… Is it really alright to call yourself the number one mage in Axel like this?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, I get it, Kazuma. In order to call myself the number one in Axel, I need to not only best all the mages in this town, but also all the other strong people, right?”</p>

  <p>“Nobody said anything like that.”</p>

  <p>But Megumin ignored my words, flared her mantle, and took out her notebook.</p>

  <p>“This notebook has all the strong people in Axel written down. I’ve been working my way through it day by day, and now there’s only one name left. And today, I’ll prove I’m number one in Axel!”</p>

  <p>“Have a safe trip,” they said in unison.</p>

  <p>“What are you saying!? You guys are coming with me too! I need someone to bear witness that I am the strongest in Axel!”</p>

  <p>“Eeeh…” they groaned in unison.</p>

  <p>And thus, my peaceful morning was shattered, and I was dragged into yet another bothersome situation.</p>

  <p>And the first place Megumin led us to was…</p>

  <p>“…You know, isn’t this aiming a little too high?”</p>

  <p>We were standing outside of Wiz’s magic item shop.</p>

  <p>“You’re misunderstanding. I’m not here to challenge Wiz or Vanir. Besides, I’ve already beaten them.”</p>

  <p>Megumin said that like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p>

  <p>“Oh? When did you beat them?”</p>

  <p>“I took out one of Vanir’s lives with my Explosion back when he was possessing Darkness, didn’t I? And I beat Wiz in that Explosion contest a few days back. That’s basically the same as beating her, isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>Is that really okay?</p>

  <p>“Wait, then, Megumin, who did you come here to challenge today?”</p>

  <p>“The one I’m looking for is my long-standing rival—someone I absolutely have to defeat. I’ve beaten her countless times in non-combat challenges, but we’ve never properly settled things in a real duel. She has no friends, but I know she comes to this store all the time, so…”</p>

  <p>Saying that, Megumin opened the door.</p>

  <p>“Pardon me!”</p>

  <p>“Ah, welcome!”</p>

  <p>The only one who greeted her was Wiz, who looked bored behind the counter.</p>

  <p>“Please excuse me.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Megumin, that’s really rude! I know you’re looking for someone, but don’t just turn around and leave because she isn’t here!”</p>

  <p>Darkness hastily stopped Megumin before she could leave.</p>

  <p>“Yeah, now that we’ve come all the way out here, let’s have some tea before we go. Wiz uses cheap tea leaves, but she brews a shockingly good cup.”</p>

  <p>“Thanks, Aqua. I’ll go put some tea on, then.”</p>

  <p>Wiz immediately started preparing tea as if it were a given.</p>

  <p>That Aqua… She doesn’t come here every day just to mooch tea and snacks, does she?</p>

  <p>“By the way, what brings all of you here today?”</p>

  <p>Wiz asked as she set some water to boil over a little alcohol burner.</p>

  <p>“Well, Megumin wanted to challenge the strong people in this town, so we ended up here.”</p>

  <p>“Huh? Even if you say that, I’m already retired…! But if Megumin insists…”</p>

  <p>“No, that’s not it! I didn’t come here to challenge Wiz today. Why does Wiz seem like she’s looking forward to this?”</p>

  <p>Despite acting like she’s only reluctantly agreeing to this, I can tell that she’s quite excited.</p>

  <p>Wiz is usually calm, but I’d heard she was an incredible adventurer before she became a lich. Maybe she has a competitive streak.</p>

  <p>Megumin hadn’t planned on challenging a lich in the first place, but Wiz’s enthusiasm still made her panic.</p>

  <p>“Oho, so the strong person you’re looking for is the Vanir, said to (possibly) be even stronger than the Demon King himself. Very well, I, Vanir, the Archduke of Hell, shall be your opponent!”</p>

  <p>Vanir, clad in his apron, appeared from the back room and declared with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Actually, is it just me, or does he seem really enthusiastic about this too?</p>

  <p>“T-That’s not it either! The one I’m looking for is that long-term customer of this store! She shouldn’t have anywhere else to be, so why isn’t that loner here!?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, so your business is with that girl… Hmm… My all-seeing eyes say she’s sitting in the adventurers’ guild right now, eagerly waiting to run into you.”</p>

  <p>She could’ve just come straight to the mansion. She really should stop doing things the hard way.</p>

  <p>“Man, Wiz’s tea really is delicious. I’m half-tempted to hire you just to brew tea.”</p>

  <p>“The store’s finances aren’t looking too great right now, so if it comes to that… I’ll be relying on you…”</p>

  <p>Darkness looked like she was really enjoying Wiz’s tea.</p>

  <p>Next to her, Aqua was already scanning the store for snacks to go with her tea.</p>

  <p>Vanir shot the tea-party goddess an irritated look.</p>

  <p>“How long are you going to treat this place like a cafe? Perhaps it’s time I start charging for the tea.”</p>

  <p>“What are you talking about, you freeloading devil? I’ve been treating this place like a cafe since before you showed up. In other words, this is my turf. You’re the newcomer, so don’t lecture me.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Aqua’s retort, Vanir’s body started trembling.</p>

  <p>“Freeloading devil… Vanir, who spends all day helping the useless shopkeep keep her store running, is a freeloader… Fuhahaha! You’ve got some nerve, you fraud of mysterious age and background! …Perhaps I shall determine your true age with my all-seeing eyes… Oh my, what is this blinding light that blocks my vision? If I can’t see through it, then I have no way to conclusively prove you aren’t an old hag after all. Ah, if only my powers were a little stronger. My, my—what a pity.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, I see, who you wish to fight isn’t Megumin, but me. Fine, bring it on! I’ll send a small fry devil like you back to hell with a single strike of my God Blow!”</p>

  <p>“Ah, um, can the two of you please…”</p>

  <p>Wiz started to panic as the two of them went at it again.</p>

  <p>“Err, well, thanks for the information on that girl. Now then, sorry for leaving just as things are getting going, but let’s head over to the Adventurer’s guild… Ah—what are you doing? Could you please let go of my mantle?”</p>

  <p>Vanir grabbed Megumin by the mantle before she could leave.</p>

  <p>“Fuhahaha! It’s only polite to offer compensation in exchange for information, is it not? Furthermore, I am the great devil who sees through all! After receiving valuable information from a source as great as I, surely you don’t intend to simply leave without offering something in return! Now, now—it’s not like I’m asking for money. This hopeless shopkeeper brought in some goods recently, so simply buy a few fine items from me and we’ll call it even!”</p>

  <p>“Vanir, Vanir, what are you saying? Didn’t she tell us in person that she’d be waiting at the guild today, so she won’t be—Ah, ow, ow, ow!”</p>

  <p>After having his secrets revealed, Vanir grabbed Wiz by the head to shut her up.</p>

  <p>“Now, now, the product I offer you today is this! This isn’t like the usual junk in this store—it’s genuinely useful. Using it will temporarily boost a person’s magic power by an incredible amount. Yes, with this, you could unleash an explosion far stronger than even your wildest-”</p>

  <p>“I’ll take it! I’ll definitely buy it!”</p>

  <p>Holding Megumin back—she’d agreed to buy it instantly despite having next to no money—I did what I always do and asked for details.</p>

  <p>“So what’s the catch?”</p>

  <p>“In exchange, it consumes the user’s life force. Anyone who uses it will inevitably die.”</p>

  <p>“We don’t need that!”</p>

  <p>I have no idea what kind of person would even make use of such a dangerous item.</p>

  <p>Though, Megumin’s eyes started sparkling for some reason.</p>

  <p>“I’ll buy it! I want it! I definitely want it! Burning my life to surpass my limits, isn’t that just like what I’ve been chasing all this time!?”</p>

  <p>“Why are you so eager to die!? Haven’t you thought about living a leisurely life!? Just because you’re a user of Explosion magic doesn’t mean you need to live your life like a firework!”</p>

  <p>Just as I was dealing with Megumin who seemed really taken with it for some reason, Wiz, who was pouring tea for Darkness and Aqua, looked at the item in Vanir’s hand and exclaimed.</p>

  <p>“Vanir, that isn’t for sale! I just bought it for nostalgia’s sake! That’s something that no human should ever use!”</p>

  <p>“You used this item in your duel against me in the past, so what are you saying? Why would you find value in such a thing? If we sell this to the girl who lives a dreadful life every day, not knowing if the next day is the day she finally dies, both me and her would be happy.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, don’t make it sound like I’m harbouring suicidal thoughts!”</p>

  <p>It feels like I heard something really concerning just now…</p>

  <p>Leaving the two of them to quibble over the magic item, Megumin confirmed that Aqua and Darkness have finished their tea and are getting ready to leave before saying,</p>

  <p>“Well, you two seem like you’re in the middle of something, so it’s about time we move on.”</p>

  <p>“A-After causing all that ruckus, you guys really intend on leaving after drinking tea!?”</p>

  <p>Leaving Wiz’s magic item shop behind us, we headed over to the adventurer’s guild.</p>

  <p>“Oh, yeah, Megumin, you said you defeated all the strong people in this town, but did you win against, uh, I forgot his name, but did you win against that magic sword user too?”</p>

  <p>“You’re talking about that guy with the name that sounds like some kind of food—Mitarashi, or something like that—right? Of course I beat him. When I challenged him, he said some naive-sounding things like ’I don’t hit women. That said, after losing to you and that mysterious masked man, I’ve sworn never to lose to anyone, so I shall withstand whatever blows you have until you give up’, so I stole his sword while his guard was down and only offered to return it if he admits defeat.”</p>

  <p>“You really are ruthless. I’m sure he said something like he couldn’t be bothered to play with an idiot like you and admitted defeat right?”</p>

  <p>After expressing my exasperation with Megumin’s tactics, we arrived at the guild.</p>

  <p>“This time, I’ll definitely settle things with my rival. Kazuma, please properly take in my firework-like lifestyle.”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yeah… Did she take what I said just now as praise?”</p>

  <p>After slapping her cheeks a couple of times to raise her spirits, she boldly strutted through the doors like she did earlier and exclaimed.</p>

  <p>“Pardon me!”</p>

  <p>“Hmm? Oh, hey, Megumin! It’s been a while!”</p>

  <p>The one who responded was Chris, sitting at a table next to the entrance.</p>

  <p>“So the rival you were referring to was Chris?”</p>

  <p>“No it isn’t!”</p>

  <p>More importantly, the girl she was actually looking for was nowhere to be found.</p>

  <p>“I heard you recently came back to Axel, but what are you doing drinking beer this early? Seriously, for a devout Eris cultist, you’ve always been…”</p>

  <p>“I’ve been running around all over the place lately, so I haven’t had the chance to sit and drink beer like this. Cut me some slack, Darkness. A-Anyway, what’s up with everyone? Megumin seems to be in quite high spirits today.”</p>

  <p>Chris asked, foam from her crimson beer still clinging to the corners of her mouth.</p>

  <p>“Well, I came to the guild to settle things with that girl—Ah!”</p>

  <p>“W-What’s wrong? Why did you suddenly raise your voice like that? If you’re hungry, you can help yourself to some of my snacks.”</p>

  <p>Chris slid her bowl of snacks across the table, but—strangely—it wasn’t Megumin who accepted them. It was Aqua.</p>

  <p>Ignoring Aqua, who was happily digging into the snacks without a care in the world, Megumin said to Chris,</p>

  <p>“I was counting it as my win since I couldn’t find you in town, but this is perfect. Now that you’re here, why don’t you engage in a fight-to-the-death duel with me?”</p>

  <p>“No, wait, I have no idea what you’re saying! Hey, please explain!”</p>

  <p>—After I explained the situation to Chris.</p>

  <p>“It’s pretty strange for a thief like me to appear on that list…”</p>

  <p>“Well, even if you tell me that… I think Megumin just wrote down anyone in Axel who came to mind.”</p>

  <p>Looking down at Megumin’s list, it wasn’t so much ’the strongest people in Axel’ as it was a list of our acquaintances.</p>

  <p>Well, then again, most of the strong people in this town are also our acquaintances…</p>

  <p>“So, Chris, please have a duel with me!”</p>

  <p>“Just treat it as my loss, I can’t really fight anyway… W-What’s wrong, Aqua?”</p>

  <p>Aqua was staring intensely at Chris. That expression of hers, it’s like she was looking at something really unbelievable and yet somehow nostalgic…</p>

  <p>“Say, Chris, have we met somewhere before? I can’t quite put my finger on it, but when I look at Chris this closely, she feels kind of strange. I wonder why? It’s a strange, nostalgic feeling…”</p>

  <p>Aqua’s sudden words gave Chris and I a shock.</p>

  <p>The scary thing about Aqua is that she occasionally becomes inexplicably sharp, just like now.</p>

  <p>“Oh, I get it now! Chris, did you work at that somewhat suspicious bar on third street before? The one where the girls wear really short skirts and will drink with you if you pay enough?”</p>

  <p>“I’ve never worked at such a place!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aqua, why have I never heard of such a store before!? Tell me more details!”</p>

  <p>Guess it was just my imagination.</p>

  <p>Never mind that. Just give me more details about the shop.</p>

  <p>“All right, let’s put a star next to Chris’s name… Now Yunyun’s the only one left. Why does she have to disappear the moment we’re looking for her?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, if you’re talking about Yunyun, she was here for a while, but she left a little bit ago. She looked like she’d just steeled herself to fight someone really strong…”</p>

  <p>After hearing that from Chris, we bid her farewell and headed straight back home.</p>

  <p>The long-standing rival of Megumin that we went all over town looking for is…</p>

  <p>“So there you were! Seriously, just when I want to see you, you completely vanish!”</p>

  <p>“E-Eh? M-Megumin wants to see me?”</p>

  <p>I’m sure it took Yunyun a lot of courage to work up the nerve to visit our house.</p>

  <p>Of course, after all that, nobody was home, and we ran into her just as she was trudging back with a depressed look on her face.</p>

  <p>“A-Ah… I-I bought a small house so my friends can come visit me whenever they want! I’m going back home to wait! I’m definitely not wandering around town aimlessly!”</p>

  <p>“What are you saying all of a sudden! No one asked you that! That’s way too heavy!”</p>

  <p>Yunyun must have been overjoyed to run into her friends, because she immediately started saying nonsense.</p>

  <p>Megumin slapped her down, flared her mantle, and, while being surrounded by a small crowd, loudly declared,</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Megumin! Wielder of Explosion magic and the number one mage in Axel! My rival, Yunyun, I’ve come to challenge you to a duel!”</p>

  <p>“Eeeh!? Megumin, you’re challenging me!? N-Normally you’d find it bothersome to be challenged, but now you’re…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun slowly lowered her head after listening to Megumin’s declaration.</p>

  <p>“Sob… What’s going on today? First you come looking for me, and now you’re voluntarily challenging me to the duel I’ve always wanted… I’m so happy I could die…”</p>

  <p>“It’s important, but do you really have to cry like this!? Oh, and by the way—the winner of this duel gets to call herself number one in Axel. So, what’ll it be? I don’t mind if you forfeit and let me win by default!”</p>

  <p>Hearing Megumin’s provocations, Yunyun wiped away her tears.</p>

  <p>“Of course I’ll accept! …It’s way too embarrassing, so I don’t do this normally, but in this case…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun cleared her throat.</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Yunyun! An Archmage who wields advanced magic… the strongest mage of the Crimson Demons and the one who will eventually become the best mage in the world!”</p>

  <p>Hearing those rarely spoken words, the surrounding onlookers let out an excited cheer.</p>

  <p>Megumin seemed a little miffed that the cheers were louder than when she introduced herself.</p>

  <p>“My rival Yunyun! Today, we shall finally settle our score!”</p>

  <p>“I wouldn’t have it any other way, Megumin! We shall finally put an end to this long battle of ours and fulfill the long-standing dream of our clan!”</p>

  <p>With their eyes glowing red, the two Crimson Demons stared each other down as the crowd cheered around them.</p>

  <p>With the tension peaking, the two of them nodded and…</p>

  <p>“… No, wait, what was that about the long-standing dream of our clan? I’m a Crimson Demon too, so why is defeating me the dream of our clan!?”</p>

  <p>“You need to read the mood a little! I went out and struck a pose and everything, but what exactly should we compete in!?”</p>

  <p>Having calmed down, Yunyun finally took a good look at her surroundings and blushed.</p>

  <p>Well, these two have never fought a proper duel before, so I’m sure this time will end like all the previous-</p>

  <p>“Let’s settle this with magic like proper Crimson Demons!”</p>

  <p>Hearing Megumin’s completely unexpected words, not only Yunyun, even the rest of us were taken aback.</p>

  <p>—The location was the plains a short distance outside Axel.</p>

  <p>This place is home to creatures you could call our starting point—and our natural enemy…</p>

  <p>“Fireball! …Yes, that makes nine toads!”</p>

  <p>The duel ended up being a contest to see who could take down the most of Axel’s famous giant toads.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the only way to take down a toad was with magic.</p>

  <p>“Lightning!”</p>

  <p>From the start, Yunyun used the more mana-efficient intermediate spells instead of advanced magic to take down the toads.</p>

  <p>Against weak creatures like Giant Toads, intermediate magic is more than enough.</p>

  <p>There’s no need to resort to overkill like Explosion. Matching your spells to your opponent’s level is the smartest—and most efficient—way to fight.</p>

  <p>“*Pant, pant*… Looks like you chose the wrong contest, Megumin! You didn’t forget I can use intermediate magic too, did you!? *Pant* I can still take on five more like this!”</p>

  <p>“Hmph… that kind of slow and plodding fighting style isn’t like me. A single blast of Explosion is enough to vanquish all my enemies.”</p>

  <p>Megumin sounded calm, but cold sweat was running down from under her hat.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she really did forget that Yunyun could use intermediate magic.</p>

  <p>“This is the last one! Light of Saber!”</p>

  <p>Finishing the last one with advanced magic, Yunyun ended up with 16 total kills.</p>

  <p>“So, what did you think? My levels went up by quite a bit. That’s the benefit of being in a solo party.”</p>

  <p>Yunyun, sprawled on the ground, said with a satisfied smile.</p>

  <p>“That’s pretty good. Is this the first time you’ve experienced the benefit of being a loner?”</p>

  <p>“I’m not a loner, I’m in a solo party!”</p>

  <p>With her mana exhausted, Yunyun could only complain.</p>

  <p>Unperturbed, Megumin stood up and flared her cape.</p>

  <p>“It’s my turn then. Allow me to demonstrate what true Explosion is.”</p>

  <p>—Aqua’s and Darkness’s voices echoed across the plain.</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! Megumin, I lured in a ton of toads with my monster-luring skill, so hurry up and take care of them!”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, I pulled a bunch of them in with my taunt too! The rest is up to you!”</p>

  <p>Raising her staff to the sky, Megumin smiled and nodded to Aqua and Darkness.</p>

  <p>“No fair! No fair! No fair! Megumin, that’s cheating!!”</p>

  <p>Still lying on the ground due to mana exhaustion, Yunyun whined at Megumin.</p>

  <p>“How annoying. I did say only toads defeated with magic would count, but other than that, there’s nothing forbidding your companions from helping. You always fail to confirm the rules properly whenever you challenge me—that’s why you always lose. The strength of Crimson Demons isn’t just our magic power, but our intelligence too! Using your head is part of it… Seriously, if you call yourself my rival, you should mature in ways other than your body.”</p>

  <p>“What intelligence, you’re just being underhanded! That’s cheating! Lowlife-min! … Ah, wait, no, stop!”</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of Yunyun being unable to move, Lowlife-min pinched her cheeks in revenge. Just then…</p>

  <p>“Hey, Megumin, why haven’t you used your magic yet!? They’ve almost caught up!”</p>

  <p>Looking at Aqua heading towards us, Megumin gave me a signal.</p>

  <p>“…Ah, wait, Lowlife-min, you can’t—! Using Drain Touch to siphon mana from your companions is way too low!”</p>

  <p>“Oh, shut up. If that was a rule, you should’ve said so at the start! Or you could’ve just brought some companions and had them give you mana!”</p>

  <p>“Uwaaah!”</p>

  <p>After delivering some finishing lines to Yunyun and driving her to tears, Megumin started chanting with the mana she received from me.</p>

  <p>“With this, I’ll become the number one in Axel. The title of the strongest is mine!”</p>

  <p>Her eyes glowing a bright red, she pointed her staff towards the horde of toads.</p>

  <p>“Explosion!!”</p>

  <p>A far stronger explosion than anything I’ve seen before was released into the middle of the horde.</p>

  <p>“Hmph… There’s no need to even count them. Every single one of them was eradicated by me. So, will you acknowledge my victory now?”</p>

  <p>“Sob… Fine, I admit that it’s your victory today. But next time… Next time…”</p>

  <p>The two Crimson Demons kept talking while lying flat on the ground.</p>

  <p>“Mwahaha… Mwahahahaha! With this, I’m the strongest! I am the number one in Axel! No one will be able to say I’m exaggerating!”</p>

  <p>Just as Megumin was laughing,</p>

  <p>“Right, so who’s going first?”</p>

  <p>“The one who beats Megumin has to face challenges from the remaining two, right? Then the one who goes last has the advantage. I’m a weak support class, so I think I’ll go last.”</p>

  <p>“If you’re going to put it that way, then I should be the weakest. I, too, would like to go last.”</p>

  <p>The three of us surrounding Megumin started discussing amongst ourselves.</p>

  <p>Sensing that something is off, Megumin started fidgeting, but was of course unable to stand back up.</p>

  <p>“…Umm, what are the three of you saying? Never mind that—Kazuma, can you give me some mana with Drain Touch? Just enough to move will be fine…”</p>

  <p>Megumin said in a wavering voice, her face drained of blood.</p>

  <p>“Oh, fine, then I shall go first. As a frontline class, I have the confidence to stand up to an Archpriest and an Adventurer.”</p>

  <p>Sitting next to Megumin, Darkness regarded her with an extremely serious expression and said-</p>

  <p>“My Name Is Lalatina Ford Dustiness. I request a duel with the strongest mage in Axel, Megumin, for the title of the strongest!”</p>

  <p>“I have no idea what you’re saying! Darkness, you’re not angry, are you? You’re not still holding a grudge because I challenged the mages in town and made you spend all that effort for nothing, are you!?”</p>

  <p>Megumin screamed as she struggled.</p>

  <p>“The rules of the duel would continue until someone admits defeat. Now, now, there’s no need to worry. As a Crusader, there’s no way I would do anything too outrageous to a defenseless young girl. But, I suggest you surrender early. You’d find it hard to breathe if you laugh too violently, after all.”</p>

  <p>Just then, Yunyun weakly raised her head, a wide grin plastered across her face.</p>

  <p>“I get it, I’ll apologize, so please, if you’re going to do this, please wait till I’ve recovered my mana…!”</p>

  <p>Maniacal laughter echoed across the plains of Axel-</p>

  <p>What happened after that involved someone panting heavily with a beet red face, and someone crying as they ran around. There wasn’t anything particularly noteworthy to report.</p>

  <p>…Ah, no wait, perhaps there is something noteworthy.</p>

  <p>My Name Is Kazuma, wielder of many skills and the number one adventurer in Axel.</p>
