  <p>Cooking sounded like a hassle, so I grabbed lunch and wandered around Axel to walk it off.</p>

  <p>Just then, I spotted someone I knew hiding behind a wall and peeking around the corner.</p>

  <p>“Oh? Hey, isn’t that Yunyun? What are you doing?”</p>

  <p>It was Yunyun.</p>

  <p>“What are you peeking at? Cats? Or are a couple of neroids going at it or something?”</p>

  <p>“Of course not! Why would I want to see that!? Just look—see for yourself!”</p>

  <p>I did as she said and peeked past the wall.</p>

  <p>Megumin was there, wearing a black dress.</p>

  <p>“Oh, I get it. You’re stalking Megumin like always.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t stalk Megumin! What kind of person do you think I am!?”</p>

  <p>Yunyun’s eyes started glowing, so I put a finger to my lips and shushed her.</p>

  <p>“You’re too loud. She’ll notice. Still, what’s with the outfit? There’s no festival going on, so why’s she dressed like that? I don’t know where she’s headed, but this looks interesting. I’ll tag along for a bit.”</p>

  <p>“I know, I’m curious too, so I started following her… And for some reason, hearing you say that makes me feel really uncomfortable.”</p>

  <p>Ignoring Yunyun muttering something under her breath, I crept after Megumin as she slipped into a back alley.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Megumin seemed to spot something and came to a stop.</p>

  <p>“Oh, looks like a couple of neroids are mating over there.”</p>

  <p>“Is watching neroids mate really that interesting? Why does Megumin look so captivated?”</p>

  <p>“No, anyone would stop and look. Also, what even are neroids, anyway?”</p>

  <p>“I want to know too. How does everyone casually turn them into drinks? What are they, really?”</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later…</p>

  <p>“I never knew the mating ritual of neroids could be so moving…”</p>

  <p>“Even Megumin was moved to tears…”</p>

  <p>With her eyes red from tears and emotion, Yunyun said that as we continued following Megumin.</p>

  <p>After leaving the alley, Megumin headed to the theater.</p>

  <p>She studied the posters out front with a serious look on her face.</p>

  <p>“Is there a show she wants to see?”</p>

  <p>“Ah, I know! She’s probably here for <em>Abarenbo Gunsho</em> or <em>The Return of Baron Putankim</em>! <em>Abarenbo Gunsho</em> is really interesting, so we could…”</p>

  <p>[TL note: <em>Abarenbo Gunsho</em> (lit. “Rogue Monarch”) is a parody of <em>Abarenbou Shogun</em> (lit. “Rogue General”), a popular television program involving fictionalized events in the life of Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun.]</p>

  <p>“Hey, you’re too loud, and your eyes are glowing! I get being passionate about a show you like, but keep it down or we’ll get spotted!”</p>

  <p>Five minutes later…</p>

  <p>“Then the village elder said, ‘If there isn’t any bread, then let us feast on the monsters.’ They say that’s where the tradition of eating monster meat began, even though it used to be taboo. After that crisis, every town came up with its own local monster specialty…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Megumin’s leaving. <em>Abarenbo Gunsho</em> is interesting, so I might come back later, but for now, let’s follow her.”</p>

  <p>After getting her fill, Megumin left the theater, and we followed.</p>

  <p>Then Yunyun said shyly,</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, are you into <em>Abarenbo Gunsho</em> too? What a coincidence—I-I like it too. Um… can you go into a theater by yourself? I’m used to it now, but… going alone is actually pretty hard. Do you have someone to go with? I mean, it’s not really my place to say, but, um… if you don’t mind…”</p>

  <p>“Okay, fine, we’ll go together. And if you still feel awkward, I’ll drag Megumin along too, so stop making it sound so pathetic!”</p>

  <p>Just then, for some reason, Megumin walked into the police station.</p>

  <p>Did she dress up just to turn herself in!?</p>

  <p>Yunyun and I barged in and shouted at the officer talking to Megumin:</p>

  <p>“Sorry, I’m her guardian! We’re really sorry for whatever happened!”</p>

  <p>“Megumin, you idiot, what did you do this time!?”</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later…</p>

  <p>“Seriously, what is wrong with you two? Don’t just assume I committed a crime just because I walked into a police station!”</p>

  <p>Maybe if you didn’t act like that every day, we wouldn’t jump to that conclusion.</p>

  <p>“I’m sorry, Megumin. But there was no way I could’ve guessed you were modeling for a police poster…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, what do you mean by that? Say it clearly!”</p>

  <p>Turns out Megumin was dressed like that because she’d accepted a modeling job.</p>

  <p>“Still, Megumin being the face of the police… People have some weird tastes…”</p>

  <p>“Hey! What do you mean by ‘weird tastes’!? Say it clearly!”</p>

  <p>Hearing us, the officer said,</p>

  <p>“Ah, she isn’t modeling for a police promotional poster. It’s an anti-sexual-harassment poster.”</p>

  <p>“Huh?”</p>

  <p>We turned around and saw what looked like a draft of the poster.</p>

  <p>In the center was the face of a scary-looking girl with glowing red eyes, and below it were the words:</p>

  <p>“Beware of dark roads and Crimson Demons.”</p>

  <p>In big, bold letters. The rest of the poster warned about the terrifying consequences of committing sexual harassment in this town.</p>
