  <hr/>

  <p>After wandering around the village for ages, I finally found someone I knew.</p>

  <p>The girl sitting on the bench next to the roasted sweet potato stand, scribbling away at something, is Big Sis’s friend. Her name is…</p>

  <p>“Amure! I found Amure!”</p>

  <p>“It’s Arue. My name isn’t Amure—it’s Arue. What’s wrong, Komekko? You look pretty worked up. Do you need something?”</p>

  <p>Arue crouched down and brought her face level with mine.</p>

  <p>“I haven’t eaten in three days.”</p>

  <p>“Weren’t you eating just fine after scamming Bukkororii yesterday…? Fine. Want me to treat you to a roasted sweet potato?”</p>

  <p>I nodded hard. Arue grinned and ordered a roasted sweet potato for me.</p>

  <p>As I took my first bite, I remembered why I’d come here in the first place.</p>

  <p>“Amure, this! Read it for me!”</p>

  <p>“M-My name is Arue… A letter? Oh, it’s from Megumin. Let me see…”</p>

  <p>Arue opened the letter with an eager look and started reading it out loud.</p>

  <p>“To my dear little sister, Komekko. By the time you’ve found someone to read this letter to you, I will have already found a wonderful party in Axel and made my name known. On the journey, I taught the Axis Cult an extremely effective recruiting method and saved them, and I also defeated a female devil that attacked our caravan with my powerful spell, along with many other incredible feats. Behave yourself at home and look forward to letters detailing my glorious exploits. Have you been eating properly? Are you brushing your teeth every day? Did you remember to lock the doors and windows before going to bed…”</p>

  <p>“I’m bored.”</p>

  <p>“That was fast! Well, the rest is probably just her fussing over you anyway. I guess Megumin has a doting side too.”</p>

  <p>Arue chuckled as she skimmed the rest of the page.</p>

  <p>“Oh, there’s an address at the bottom. Looks like she rented a post box so you can send her a letter whenever you miss her. So, what do you think? I can help you write a reply if you want.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t miss Big Sis. And writing a letter sounds like work, so I’m not doing it.”</p>

  <p>“I-Is that so? I think you should reply. It’ll make Megumin happy, and honestly, this is probably her way of saying she misses you.”</p>

  <p>“…Okay. Let’s write one.”</p>

  <p>Even after leaving the village, Big Sis is still a spoiled girl who craves attention.</p>

  <p>But if it’ll make Big Sis happy, then I’ll let Arue help me write a reply.</p>

  <p>“Good. So what do you want to write? How about telling her you’re doing fine, and you can take care of the house all on your own? That should put her at ease.”</p>

  <p>I nodded at Arue’s suggestion and said,</p>

  <p>“Then write… Now that Big Sis isn’t here, all your food is mine. The adults are really worried about me without Big Sis around, so they keep giving me lots of food. I’m very happy Big Sis isn’t here. There’s no need to hurry home, Big Sis.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t write that! You’ll make Megumin cry! I said to put her at ease—maybe we should change the wording a little?”</p>

  <p>Arue balled up the paper and muttered something about honest children being terrifying.</p>

  <p>“Then how about… Lots of different people treat me to food every day. Bukkororii has been crying that he gets less to eat now that I stop by every day. Then his dad yelled at him to get a job if he doesn’t like it, and started using magic inside the house. I ignored it and kept eating.”</p>

  <p>“You really do end up in ridiculous situations. And I have to say, you shouldn’t just keep eating in that situation. You should run. Seriously… I feel like you’re going to grow up to be someone terrifying.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, and… I made friends with a huge, strong, black goblin. He said he’ll become my familiar when I’m a great mage.”</p>

  <p>“K-Komekko, what did you just say? What do you mean, ‘goblin’? Tell your big sister more!”</p>

  <p>Arue tossed her pen aside and grabbed me by the shoulders, shaking me hard.</p>

  <p>“You didn’t go outside the village, did you? Your big sister won’t get mad, so tell me the truth.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t go out often.”</p>

  <p>“That means you go out sometimes, right!? Listen—there are really strong monsters outside the village. You’ll make Megumin worry, so don’t go outside again!”</p>

  <p>At Arue’s serious expression, I nodded firmly.</p>

  <p>“Sigh… I can’t put that in the letter either… What even is that ‘huge goblin,’ anyway? Let’s just add some encouraging words at the end. That’ll make Megumin happy… And yeah, Komekko—you’re definitely going to grow up to be someone incredible. Definitely.”</p>

  <p>Arue sighed and patted my head.</p>

  <p>“Then write… Please kill the Demon King and become the strongest mage.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, yes—bringing up the Demon King is a stroke of genius. That’ll definitely motivate Megumin. As expected of the girl who’s going to be someone incredible in the magical community. I didn’t misjudge you, Komekko.”</p>

  <p>“Be sure to bring back the Demon King’s body. I’ve always wanted to know what the Demon King tastes like. Sincerely, Komekko.”</p>

  <p>“This girl is already incredible!”</p>
