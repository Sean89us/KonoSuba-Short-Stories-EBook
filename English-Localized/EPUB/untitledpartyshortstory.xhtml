  <p>[Originally linked by Natsume from his blog on May 2nd, 2014, this story (and several more!) was never officially published. It might be that he dropped them, or that they didn’t make the cut (or maybe he just wanted to have fun?). In any case, this takes place around volume 4, so the status quo and character relationships are a little different from the later volumes. Thanks to Striker for digging these up.]</p>

  <p>Aqua and the others were apparently planning to surprise me as thanks for putting up with them every day.</p>

  <p>I heard it by accident from an adventurer I know.</p>

  <p>And the very next day, Aqua called me over like it was no big deal.</p>

  <p>So this is what it feels like when you find out your friends are planning a surprise party behind your back.</p>

  <p>I stepped out into the backyard with my heart pounding and found my companions playing some weird game.</p>

  <p>“Out! Darkness, you’re out!”</p>

  <p>“That’s impossible! I should’ve been safe by a hair!”</p>

  <p>“From where I’m standing, you’re out. Which means it’s Aqua’s turn next.”</p>

  <p>Going by the words they were using, it sounded like baseball… but they didn’t have any equipment.</p>

  <p>Then Aqua noticed me and waved me over.</p>

  <p>“You got here at the perfect time. Kazuma, you be the ref. We can’t make a fair call with just the three of us.”</p>

  <p>…You want me to be the ref?</p>

  <p>“Sure, but what are you even playing? It’s not baseball, right?”</p>

  <p>I asked casually, but Aqua wasn’t the only one who looked surprised—Megumin and Darkness stared at me too.</p>

  <p>“Come on, Kazuma, you can tell what this is just by looking, right? You’ve been in this world long enough—if you still don’t know, I’d be too embarrassed to show my face in public.”</p>

  <p>“Knock it off, Aqua. Kazuma’s obviously kidding. There’s no way he doesn’t know.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah. Kazuma’s always out gathering info. There’s no way he wouldn’t know.”</p>

  <p>What game were they even playing?</p>

  <p>More importantly, I had no idea what they were plotting.</p>

  <p>Was this some common local pastime? Or just another one of this world’s weird traditions?</p>

  <p>While I desperately tried to come up with something, Aqua huddled up with the other two and whispered to them.</p>

  <p>“Hey, does he seriously not know? If that’s true, I’m gonna be so disappointed in him.”</p>

  <p>“No way. It’s Kazuma, you know? He’s not as clueless as us…”</p>

  <p>“For the guy who’s always treating us like problem children to not know this…”</p>

  <p>They were whispering, but not exactly quietly. I could hear every word.</p>

  <p>Was not knowing this game really that big of a deal?</p>

  <p>Uh-oh. Now I was getting nervous.</p>

  <p>“O-Of course I know. But are you sure you want me as the ref? I’ve never done this before, so maybe you should get someone else…”</p>

  <p>I played it off like I totally knew what was going on.</p>

  <p>I’d keep up the act for now and look it up later.</p>

  <p>Just as I was thinking that—</p>

  <p>“What are you talking about? You need a guy to be the ref. It’s easy—just take off your shoes and sit on your knees over there.”</p>

  <p>That’s what Aqua said.</p>

  <p>I knew this world was weird, but what kind of rule was that?</p>

  <p>I took off my shoes like she said and sat on my knees in the grass.</p>

  <p>Megumin and Darkness turned away and crouched down too. From behind, I could see their shoulders trembling.</p>

  <p>Did the game already start?</p>

  <p>“Looks like we’re all set. All right, let’s go!”</p>

  <p>Aqua yelled, sprinted at Darkness, and used her like a springboard to vault over her.</p>

  <p>When she landed, she turned to me with a huge grin.</p>

  <p>“How was that? How many points!?”</p>

  <p>I’m supposed to score that?</p>

  <p>“Hey, not fair, Aqua! You went before we were ready—no points!”</p>

  <p>“No, from where I’m standing, that was safe. Right, Kazuma?”</p>

  <p>What was with all this “out” and “safe” stuff?</p>

  <p>Don’t ask me—I had no idea what was happening!</p>

  <p>As I struggled to respond, Aqua casually added,</p>

  <p>“Oh, right, ref. We don’t have juice for the final round. Can you go buy some for us?”</p>

  <p>“Huh? I’m the one who has to buy it!?”</p>

  <p>What kind of game was this!?</p>

  <p>Still, this was a perfect opportunity.</p>

  <p>While I was out buying juice, I could ask around town what they were even doing.</p>

  <p>As I headed for town, Aqua and the others turned their backs to me and crouched down again. Their shoulders were shaking like they were trying not to laugh.</p>

  <p>Oh, right. I almost forgot.</p>

  <p>I turned back to ask if they wanted something specific, or if any fruit juice would do…</p>

  <p>“This is amazing! I can’t believe Kazuma didn’t realize we were messing with him and actually went out to buy juice! After everything he’s put us through, this is the perfect payback! Hahahaha!”</p>

  <p>“Did he seriously not question why he had to sit barefoot on his knees? Heh… Hehehe… No, I can’t—”</p>

  <p>“I-I’ve never seen Kazuma this obedient! What was with all that ‘out’ and ‘safe’ stuff!? Anyway, let’s laugh while we still can before he comes back…”</p>

  <p>While Aqua and Darkness were still cracking up, Megumin turned around mid-snicker and came face-to-face with me.</p>

  <p>Seeing Megumin suddenly stiffen, Aqua and Darkness turned around to follow her gaze—and froze too.</p>

  <p>“All right, you three. New game I just came up with. When I say start… I chase. You three run. I use Steal. You three strip. Now take your places…!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, why are you suddenly talking like that!? Communication is important, you know! You’re joking! You’re joking, right!? Ah—wait, Megumin! Darkness too! Kazuma hasn’t said start yet…!”</p>

  <p>Start.</p>
