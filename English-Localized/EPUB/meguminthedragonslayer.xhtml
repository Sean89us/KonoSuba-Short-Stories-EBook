  <hr/>

  <p>At a quarry just outside town.</p>

  <p>“All right, young lady—I’m counting on you.”</p>

  <p>“Heh, leave it to me. Feast your eyes—I shall show you a glimpse of my true power! If I got serious, this entire quarry would…! Ah, could you stand a little farther back? Yeah, that’ll do.”</p>

  <p>The foreman and Megumin were discussing the plan for the blast.</p>

  <p>However…</p>

  <p>“Why do I have to come along?”</p>

  <p>“I don’t have a choice. After I use my magic, I won’t be able to move, so I need you to carry me home.”</p>

  <p>And for some reason, I got dragged out to the quarry, too.</p>

  <p>“You don’t need me for that. You could just have the foreman carry you back. He’s probably stronger than I am.”</p>

  <p>“What kind of nonsense is that? Look at him—he’s huge and built like a beast. If I were left alone with him while I couldn’t move, who knows what he’d do to a delicate girl like me?”</p>

  <p>“That is not going to happen!”</p>

  <p>“Hey! Why are you two yelling!? Explain it to me—slowly!”</p>

  <p>Megumin raised her staff, her eyes glowing red. Seeing that, the foreman hastily said,</p>

  <p>“W-Well, setting that aside, our problem is that giant boulder. We can’t get any work done with it in the way. I talked it over with the guild, and they recommended you. So—what do you say? Think you can handle it?”</p>

  <p>“Of course! My name is Megumin! The one who will someday slay the Demon King! A rock like that is nothing compared to—”</p>

  <p>“Pii~! Pii~!”</p>

  <p>….?</p>

  <p>A bird-like cry suddenly rang out, and we exchanged confused looks.</p>

  <p>When I looked closer at the boulder, I could make out something like a nest perched on top.</p>

  <p>“Oh, that’s a wyvern! A wyvern hatchling! Good grief—nesting this close to town… But it’s good you’re here, young lady. Blow it away along with that rock. It may be a hatchling, but wyverns are aggressive carnivores. If we leave it be, it’ll cause serious damage later. Its parents aren’t here, so this is our best chance to deal with it.”</p>

  <p>“Ah!”</p>

  <p>Hearing the engineer’s words, Megumin let out a squeak.</p>

  <p>Megumin stared at the small wyvern as it kept chirping.</p>

  <p>It was probably hard for her to finish off such a defenseless creature, but as adventurers, we can’t let dangerous monsters roam free.</p>

  <p>And this wasn’t just any monster—it was a wyvern. Once it grew up, it would definitely become a serious threat to people.</p>

  <p>But Megumin…</p>

  <p>“U..uuu…”</p>

  <p>…She wore a conflicted expression and didn’t move.</p>

  <p>In the end, Megumin chose not to cast her spell, and she lowered her head dejectedly.</p>

  <p>Seeing her, the engineer scratched his head and smiled.</p>

  <p>“Hah, well, I guess it can’t be helped! It’s probably too cruel a job for a young lady. I’ll call you back to deal with that boulder after the wyvern leaves the nest!”</p>

  <p>The foreman let out a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>Megumin seemed to brighten up upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>“Let’s take it down in a proper battle once it’s grown up.”</p>

  <p>I said with a smile.</p>

  <p>“Still, you missed out on a great opportunity, young lady. It may be small, but if you killed it, you’d still be a wyvern slayer. And wyverns are a kind of dragon, so you’d even be able to call yourself a dragon slayer.”</p>

  <p>The engineer joked.</p>

  <p>I joined in his laughter.</p>

  <p>“You can call yourself a dragon slayer even if you beat a hatchling? That’s pretty nice, isn’t it? It definitely sounds like the kind of title a hero who defeats the Demon King would have—”</p>

  <p>“Explosion-!”</p>

  <p>Megumin cut me off with her spell.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a loud boom rocked the quarry, followed by a strong shockwave.</p>

  <p>The sudden spell gave us no time to brace ourselves, and the foreman and I both went tumbling.</p>

  <p>Flat on the ground, I shifted to look around.</p>

  <p>The foreman must have hit his head—his eyes had rolled back, and he looked completely out of it.</p>

  <p>On the other side, Megumin had collapsed after spending all her magic. Without even lifting her head, she said proudly,</p>

  <p>“My name is Megumin! Wielder of explosion magic, and the one who defeated a dragon! Kazuma, from now on, call me ’Dragon Slayer Megumin.‘”</p>

  <p>“You little… Can’t you just let things end nicely for once!?”</p>
