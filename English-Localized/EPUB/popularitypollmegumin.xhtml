  <p>“Explosion!!”</p>

  <p>A huge explosion bloomed over the rocky mountains not too far from Axel.</p>

  <p>When the shockwave and dust settled, all that remained was a large crater.</p>

  <p>“Kukuku… So the pitiful sacrifice became part of my power today… However, your existence will not vanish. Indeed. After all, you’ll become the experience points of the great mage Megumin and live on forever as part of me…!”</p>

  <p>The great mage said that while collapsed on the ground.</p>

  <p>“Yeah, yeah, that lost kobold you defeated will definitely live on in your heart. Here, lift your arms up a little. I’ll carry you.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, I’m basking in the afterglow after defeating the monster in a fierce battle, so please stop calling it a lost kobold. That sense of scale really makes me feel disheartened, you know?”</p>

  <p>What fierce battle? All you did was spot a lone kobold wandering around and blow it up from afar.</p>

  <p>“…Hmm? Do you see a kobold over there? And it looks like there are two of them…”</p>

  <p>Perhaps drawn by the sound of the explosion, a few figures appeared behind a rocky outcropping in the distance and seemed to be looking our way.</p>

  <p>Using my Farsight skill, I confirmed that they really were kobolds.</p>

  <p>“They probably came looking for my sacrifice. Kazuma, please direct them to the corpse of that kobold. Let it at least rest in peace…”</p>

  <p>“No, as an adventurer, I can’t let them go. Plus… Is that really something you should be saying while lying on the ground?”</p>

  <p>I drew my bow and nocked an arrow while aiming at the faraway kobold.</p>

  <p>“Sorry, I bear no grudge against you, but… Let your life become my power… Snipe!”</p>

  <p>The arrow I fired with my skill flew straight into the chest of one of the kobolds.</p>

  <p>“That was a really nice shot, Kazuma! You always give a score to my daily Explosion spell, so I’ll do the same for you in return… Hmm, I feel like you’re showing mercy and holding back, so I’ll give it 72 points this time.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, stop. If you start scoring my shooting, I’m going to get self-conscious. Damn it, just let me take out the last one… Wait…”</p>

  <p>After being briefly distracted by Megumin, I turned back and noticed that the number of kobolds had increased.</p>

  <p>Three kobolds were pointing in our direction.</p>

  <p>“Hey, I think more kobolds are coming. Three might be hard for me to handle…”</p>

  <p>If I were alone, I could’ve managed somehow with Snipe and Lurk, but it was hard to deal with them while carrying a nearly immobile Megumin around.</p>

  <p>“Getting scared of dealing with a few kobolds is really pathetic! I’m giving you 62 points! I regret even giving you such a high score in the first place!”</p>

  <p>“If I abandon you, I’ll be able to win easily! Do you want me to prove it here and now!? … Hey, let me go! That was a joke! I won’t abandon you, so stop getting in my way! I can’t very well shoot like this!”</p>

  <p>As I tried to shake off Megumin, who clung to my pants with a death grip, the kobolds took the chance to close the distance.</p>

  <p>“You idiot, we’re really in a pinch now! I would’ve stood a better chance if I could’ve thinned their numbers with Snipe before they closed in! Ah, there’s even more now! There’s no way I can win against five of them!”</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, now isn’t the time to argue! At this point, just give me some of your mana! It’ll be a lot easier to run if we’re both moving than if you’re carrying me!”</p>

  <p>It’s all because of her that we ended up in such a crisis, but I can’t really lecture her in this situation.</p>

  <p>Using Drain Touch, I gave her some of my mana, and she immediately leapt to her feet.</p>

  <p>“I’ll go get help from Axel! Kazuma, hold them here!”</p>

  <p>“Stop joking around! I’m obviously running away with you! … Ah! You little bastard, you asked me for mana so you could sprint off and leave me behind as bait! Damn it, you don’t believe in me at all!”</p>

  <p>Megumin dashed ahead, and I followed hot on her heels.</p>

  <p>“I’d trust you a lot more if you didn’t keep saying you’d win easily if you abandoned me! … Ah, Kazuma, they’re in front, too! We’re surrounded! This is really bad!”</p>

  <p>“Dammit, how did kobolds outsmart us!? Now that it’s come to this, I’ll use my Snipe skill to thin out their numbers so we can break straight through them! Once we are through and gained some distance, I’ll use my Lurk skill to make out the rest of the way!”</p>

  <p>I raised my bow and let loose an arrow at the fast-approaching kobolds, while Megumin next to me gripped her staff in preparation for close combat—</p>

  <p>—After reaching Axel, we got in line behind the returning adventurers waiting to go through the gates.</p>

  <p>Megumin and I were completely silent.</p>

  <p>Our fierce battle with the kobolds left us completely exhausted…</p>

  <p>“Huh? M-Megumin? What a coincidence! You’re with Kazuma, so you must be coming back from your daily ritual, right?”</p>

  <p>Just then, Megumin’s self-proclaimed rival, Yunyun, showed up behind us.</p>

  <p>Along with her was a party of what looked like brand-new adventurers.</p>

  <p>“Are you friends of Yunyun? She saved us when we were being chased by a rookie killer…”</p>

  <p>“Yes, we really can’t thank her enough… If Yunyun hadn’t shown up, we would’ve been wiped out!”</p>

  <p>“Yunyun is really strong! I can’t help but look up to her!”</p>

  <p>Rookie killers are cunning, cruel monsters that lurk around goblins and kobolds. Even though those monsters aren’t especially strong, they still fetch a decent price per head.</p>

  <p>Yunyun, after receiving praise from the adventurers she saved, turned beet red and stiffened up.</p>

  <p>“I see, a rookie killer, huh? To us Crimson Demons, such creatures are but experience points. I recall ripping one to pieces when I was younger.”</p>

  <p>After hearing such a confident statement, the adventurers shifted their gaze to the other Crimson Demon.</p>

  <p>“… Oh? You ripped a rookie killer to shreds before? I’ve spent many years with you, but I didn’t know about that at all.”</p>

  <p>“Well, killing a rookie killer isn’t anything to boast about. It’s natural that you wouldn’t have known about it. I wish I could be present, but we were engaged in a fierce battle with monsters over on that mountain…. A rookie killer, huh? Well, if I was present, it would’ve been defeated in a flash.”</p>

  <p>Megumin, who had almost been defeated in battle against a band of fierce kobolds, boldly said, and Yunyun’s eyes started glowing red.</p>

  <p>“Oh, I see, so that means that there was an even stronger monster than the rookie killer around, right? Isn’t that a really big deal, Megumin? We need to report this to the guild!”</p>

  <p>“Oh, I’ve already taken care of it, so there’s no need for that! W-What are you doing!? Trying to look at my adventurer’s card without permission is a violation of my privacy!”</p>

  <p>As these two archmages started struggling over Megumin’s adventurer’s card—and, by extension, her monster kill record—the surrounding adventurers gathered around them and shouted encouragement.</p>

  <p>One of them was an archmage capable of killing a rookie killer single-handedly, admired by the new adventurers in town, while the other was a defective archmage who’d almost been defeated by a pack of kobolds…</p>

  <p>“If you aren’t lying, then show me your card! You always tell such cheap lies!”</p>

  <p>“I don’t want to hear that from you! You’re the one who keeps putting obvious lies about the many friends you’ve made in Axel in your letters back home! Oh, what’s with those eyes? You want to go? Very well, we’ll put an end to this on this very day!”</p>

  <p>These are the two Archmages fighting for the right to be called the best mage in this town, but—</p>
