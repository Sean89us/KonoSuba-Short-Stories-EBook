  <p>“Thanks for having me today.”</p>

  <p>“Dust, do you understand that money disappears when you spend it?”</p>

  <p>I’d tried to greet her cheerfully, but the Loli Succubus hit me with a question that stupid.</p>

  <p>Normally I’d fire right back, but I couldn’t afford that today—literally.</p>

  <p>“Don’t say that. If you just sit on money, the economy doesn’t move, you know? My money makes the rounds in town and keeps the wheels of prosperity turning.”</p>

  <p>“Your pocket change doesn’t even come close to what the lowest-ranking minor noble has, you know?”</p>

  <p>“You really aren’t cute at all…”</p>

  <p>“I don’t really want you to find me cute anyway. But Vanir is a different story.”</p>

  <p>She must’ve been imagining Vanir praising her, because a blush crept up her face as she fidgeted excitedly.</p>

  <p>This was a succubus shop, so she was wearing lingerie-like clothing. Normally, bouncing around in something that revealing would be dangerous in all sorts of ways, but with her petite build, it did absolutely nothing for me.</p>

  <p>All the other succubi had amazing figures, so why was she the only one who didn’t seem to develop at all?</p>

  <p>“Well, everyone values different things.”</p>

  <p>“The way you look at me when you say that kind of pisses me off.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, you shouldn’t use that tone with a regular customer. Sorry about that, Dust.”</p>

  <p>The succubus in charge apologized on her behalf.</p>

  <p>She was the Loli Succubus’s superior in every way, and seeing her… assets shift when she bowed made me forgive absolutely everything.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry about it. More importantly, I’m in your care for today’s work.”</p>

  <p>“Yes. We’ll be counting on you as a handyman and bouncer.”</p>

  <p>The succubus in charge bowed, Loli Succubus reluctantly followed.</p>

  <p>Due to certain events, I was barred from working at the Adventurer’s Guild for several days, so I had to make do with a part time job here for now.</p>

  <p>“All right, then. I’ll leave the details to you.”</p>

  <p>“Understood… Dust, please do your best not to do anything unnecessary.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah. I won’t do anything, so don’t worry.”</p>

  <p>“Um, please actually do some work…”</p>

  <p>I’d been assigned to the Loli Succubus for the day, so I figured I’d try not to cause any incidents.</p>

  <p>She brought me by the doors and told me to please stand guard there, so I leaned against the wall and looked out into the store.</p>

  <p>Just seeing succubi walk around in outfits like that made me want to earn money as fast as humanly possible.</p>

  <p>It’s still early, so there aren’t many customers yet, but soon enough this place will be filled with numerous burly adventurers.</p>

  <p>Almost on cue, a pair of adventurers I’d run into now and then strolled into the store.</p>

  <p>“What kind of dream are you getting today? Being lectured by an older woman is great, but getting pampered by someone younger sounds nice too.”</p>

  <p>“I’m going for a romance with someone way above my social status. It’s a dream, so I might as well pick something impossible in real life.”</p>

  <p>“Welcome, valued customers.”</p>

  <p>I was an employee today, so I welcomed them like I’d been told. They just stared at my face instead.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing here, Dust? This is kind of creepy.”</p>

  <p>“If you’re ordering a dream, then go home and sleep already. What are you doing lurking by the door?”</p>

  <p>It seems like they didn’t even consider that I’m working here. But, well, I suppose that’s to be expected.</p>

  <p>“I’m working here today. If you’re looking for a dream, I’ve got a few suggestions you might appreciate.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t need it! Nobody wants to hear about your tastes!”</p>

  <p>“What!? I’m genuinely offering to help, and this is how you treat me!?”</p>

  <p>Just as I considered teaching this cheeky bastard a lesson, someone whacked me on the head.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing!?”</p>

  <p>I turned around, and standing right there was Loli Succubus with a serving tray in hand.</p>

  <p>“Please don’t pick fights with the customers! I apologize for any trouble this good-for-nothing has caused.”</p>

  <p>“Ahh, it’s fine. Lolisa, you must have your hands full dealing with this guy every day.”</p>

  <p>“You two have been spending a lot of time together recently. Don’t tell me you two are…”</p>

  <p>The two of them glanced between the two of us before looking at each other.</p>

  <p>“Wait, that is not—”</p>

  <p>“That’s impossible! There’s no way I’d be with a debt-ridden, scummy, worthless guy like him! Besides, I’m a succubus! The only one I have eyes for is Vanir!”</p>

  <p>T-This girl. There’s no need to deny it so strongly that you’re red in the face.</p>

  <p>“You got it. I have no interest in you either.”</p>

  <p>“The way you’re saying it like you don’t even see me as a woman kind of pisses me off.”</p>

  <p>“You really are a troublesome girl, you know that?”</p>

  <p>While we were arguing, the two adventurers went to take a seat and started filling out their forms.</p>

  <p>Loli Succubus seemed to have calmed down after saying what she wanted to say, and went back to her work.</p>

  <p>I had nothing else to do, so I returned to my job of standing at the door.</p>

  <p>“Good work today. I’ll be back tomorrow.”</p>

  <p>After work ended and I got my pay, I said that.</p>

  <p>“Please don’t come back anymore!” x3</p>

  <p>But they instantly rejected me.</p>

  <p>“Dust, you keep peeking at the forms customers fill out and making comments like ‘Ooh, you’ve got good taste,’ and ‘Isn’t that level of play a little too advanced?,’ so you’re scaring customers away!”</p>
