  <hr/>

  <p>That day.</p>

  <p>When I came to, the first thing I saw was Darkness creeping into my room like she was about to stage a night raid.</p>

  <p>“… This is my first time, so I’d really appreciate it if you’d pay attention to the mood when you do stuff like this.”</p>

  <p>“I-Idiot, what are you saying!? Don’t say such misleading things the first thing in the morning! What were you going to do if someone saw us and got the wrong impression!?”</p>

  <p>To be specific, it wasn’t actually night, so calling it a night raid wasn’t exactly accurate.</p>

  <p>Darkness quickly hastened to shut me up, but it’s already too late…</p>

  <p>“A-Awawawawawa! Darkness is leaning over Kazuma first thing in the morning!”</p>

  <p>“Aqua!? Wait, that’s not it! I have something I need to talk to Kazuma about and wanted to wake him…!”</p>

  <p>Aqua said, peeking through the crack in the door, and Darkness hastily shouted back while covering me with my blanket.</p>

  <p>“—So in other words: you tripped over me while waiting for a good moment to wake me up, and I woke up right as you were trying to get off me without waking me?”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yes, that’s exactly it! I thought it was uncharacteristically clumsy of me too…!”</p>

  <p>Darkness seemed to be on the verge of tears as I finally understood what happened after much explanation.</p>

  <p>“So that’s when you thought, ’Since Kazuma’s already awake…‘ and decided to go through with it, right?”</p>

  <p>“Aqua, don’t butt in! Who would do something that stupid!? Ah, dammit…!”</p>

  <p>After enduring our constant teasing, Darkness took a moment to compose herself and said with a newly serious expression.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, please help me! Chris has been acting really strange lately!”</p>

  <p>—While watching over her from the shadows, Darkness whispered to Aqua and me.</p>

  <p>“… Chris has been hanging out with some unsavory characters around here lately. I wanted to ask her what she was up to myself, but, um…”</p>

  <p>Darkness trailed off, glancing between Aqua and me.</p>

  <p>“But… what? I won’t get it if you don’t say it.”</p>

  <p>When I urged her to continue, Darkness reluctantly turned towards me.</p>

  <p>“… Well, thinking about it, I also hang out with some unsavory characters…”</p>

  <p>“Oh? Oh? Darkness, you sure said something interesting, didn’t you!”</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, hold her down! I’m going to tie her hair into pigtails and parade her around the adventurers’ guild!”</p>

  <p>As the two unsavory characters closed in on Darkness, she motioned for us to be quiet between bouts of nearly silent pleading.</p>

  <p>“So this is why you brought me along… Chris has the Enemy Detection skill, so she’ll easily figure out if anyone else is following her.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, exactly. With you here, we can tail her much more closely with your Lurk skill. Normally there’s no way I could’ve followed her from this close… Ah, that’s him, Kazuma! Anyone would say that man looks to be up to no good… Ah!? He brought out a suspicious bag!”</p>

  <p>Following Darkness’s pointing, I saw Chris talking to a man wearing a thick leather jacket.</p>

  <p>The muscle-bound man with deep scars on his cheeks had a bag filled with white powder in his hands—</p>

  <p>“That’s the guy who runs the cake shop. He apparently used to be an adventurer, but he always dreamed of opening a cake shop. Looks like he’s giving Chris good flour and sugar at her request.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Darkness, get a hold of yourself! Shouldn’t you be happy we were worried over nothing!?”</p>

  <p>Darkness fell limp for a moment upon hearing Aqua’s words, but quickly leapt to her feet.</p>

  <p>“Y-Yes, that man is just the start! There’s another man I’m actually worried about!”</p>

  <p>With a slight blush, Darkness declared to cover up her misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>“—Look into that alley. You’ll understand why I’m concerned at a glance.”</p>

  <p>Chris’s next destination was a shadowy alley.</p>

  <p>Following Darkness’s instructions, I saw a man standing in the alley in a white coat with a meat cleaver hanging off his hip.</p>

  <p>His white coat seemed stained with something, so I used Farsight to take a closer look, and those stains turned out to be blood…!</p>

  <p>“That’s the butcher. He specializes in chickens and other birds… Ah, Chris just got a bag of eggs from him. That’s a relief, Darkness. Looks like she’s just out shopping.”</p>

  <p>“Darkness, calm down. Instead of beating yourself up, just be glad nothing happened to Chris.”</p>

  <p>Darkness buried her face in her hands and seemed to grow smaller.</p>

  <p>—Just then,</p>

  <p>“Say, you guys have been following me since morning. What’s going on?”</p>

  <p>She must have closed the distance while Aqua and I were busy comforting Darkness.</p>

  <p>“—Ahahaha! How foolish of you, Darkness! I’m a devout follower of Eris who loves justice, you know? There’s no way I’d end up with bad people!”</p>

  <p>After hearing our explanation, Chris let out a hearty laugh.</p>

  <p>“Kuh, I have nothing to say… To think that I would doubt a friend like that…”</p>

  <p>Chris let out a chuckle towards Darkness who fell onto her knees.</p>

  <p>“Heheheh, I’m actually happy about that. After all, it just means you care about me that much, right, Darkness?”</p>

  <p>“Uggh…. That might be true, but I judged others by their appearances and even cast my doubts on them. As a servant of Eris, I don’t think I can forgive myself…”</p>

  <p>Darkness seems to place a lot of importance on the weirdest things sometimes.</p>

  <p>Chris placed a hand on Darkness’s shoulder.</p>

  <p>“It’s fine. You might have gone a little overboard, but it was all out of concern for a friend. I’m sure Lady Eris will forgive you.”</p>

  <p>As Chris said that with a smile, Aqua interjected with something completely unnecessary.</p>

  <p>“Do you really think so? She’s really serious and inflexible, so she might not actually forgive Darkness.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aqua, you’re just making Darkness more depressed, so cut it out!”</p>

  <p>Darkness buried her head between her knees and shut herself out from the world.</p>

  <p>Though, there was something that bothered me.</p>

  <p>“Say, Chris, you bought quite a lot of things today. What are you planning to make with that?”</p>

  <p>“Eh!? That’s, um, well…”</p>

  <p>Chris stuttered while trying and failing not to look at Darkness.</p>

  <p>So it has something to do with Darkness, then?</p>

  <p>“It’s a cake! Flour, sugar, and eggs are definitely for a cake! Chris, is someone’s birthday coming up?”</p>

  <p>At Aqua’s sudden words, Darkness and Chris both seemed to stiffen up in shock.</p>

  <p>… Ah, I see what’s going on.</p>

  <p>“Alright, Aqua, let’s go home. I’ll give you some money, so buy some good wine for later, okay?”</p>

  <p>Having her plans for a surprise party revealed, Chris stood with trembling shoulders and a red face.</p>

  <p>Darkness, too, was trembling in much the same way.</p>

  <p>I turned towards the two of them and said,</p>

  <p>“I’ll have Megumin cook up a lavish feast, so you two come home early, okay?”</p>

  <p>On the way home, I bought a plush for a certain someone who, despite usually being serious and stiff, has a soft spot for cute, fancy things.</p>
