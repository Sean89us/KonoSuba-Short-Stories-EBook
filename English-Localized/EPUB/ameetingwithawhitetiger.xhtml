 <hr/>

 <p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>

 <p>This took place while I was having a late lunch at the guild.</p>

 <p>“Byakko?”</p>

 <p>After finishing my meal, I was enjoying a cup of coffee when Megumin walked up to me.</p>

 <p>“Not a byakko—it’s a white tiger.”</p>

 <p>“Isn’t that the same thing?”</p>

 <p>[TL note: Byakko (白虎) literally means “white tiger.”]</p>

 <p>The naming schemes for monsters in this world are pretty random.</p>

 <p>There are creatures like the guardian of snow sprites that some Japanese guy dubbed the Winter Shogun, and then there are monsters stuck with pathetic names like the running hawkites.</p>

 <p>Some adventurers also call that “white tiger” monster a byakko.</p>

 <p>And, as for why this topic was brought up…</p>

 <p>“Calling it a byakko makes it sound like some kind of boss monster, right? If we call it a white tiger, it sounds less threatening, so it’ll be easier to fight.”</p>

 <p>“It doesn’t matter what you call it, just hearing its name makes me not want to fight it.”</p>

 <p>Megumin was holding a poster for a kill quest: a byakko.</p>

 <p>They were offering two hundred million eris for it. That doesn’t sound like the kind of reward a regular old tiger would pull in.</p>

 <p>“It’s that one, isn’t it? Besides the tiger, there are three others—a gigantic tortoise, a phoenix, and a dragon—and all four are high-bounty targets tied to the four directions.”</p>

 <p>“Kazuma, you’re well informed. By ‘gigantic tortoise,’ you mean the Treasure Island, right? There’s a huge tortoise that uses precious gems and ore as its shell, sleeping deep underground around here. I’ve heard it comes up to bask in the sun once every ten years.”</p>

 <p>I was just drawing from the standard clichés you see in games and movies, but I can’t believe they actually exist!</p>

 <p>“That white tiger usually lives deep in the western mountains, far from human civilization, but it’s been sighted more and more lately.”</p>

 <p>Even if you tell me that…</p>

 <p>“I don’t mind going after a byakko… though there haven’t been any reports of anyone getting hurt by it. Maybe we should see it for ourselves before deciding whether to take it down. Byakko fur is supposedly beautiful and highly sought after, and I’ve heard no one’s been able to catch one because they’re incredibly fast.”</p>

 <p>Darkness, sipping tea and bearing a very interested smile, said.</p>

 <p>“I object. No matter how hard up I am, I’m still a respectable adventurer. From what you just said, it isn’t a threat to humans, right? It’d be one thing if it were dangerous, but taking a harmless life is against my creed. Anyway, I’m going home to take an afternoon nap.”</p>

 <p>“I object too. A byakko isn’t some common monster—it’s revered as a divine beast. As a goddess, it’s sort of related to me, so I have no reason to harm it. I’m going home to drink by the fireplace.”</p>

 <p>“You were happily hunting snow sprites not that long ago, so what are you saying now!? And you, Aqua—don’t start acting like a decent person only when it suits you! This is two hundred million, you know? Two hundred million! It would wipe out all our debts in an instant!”</p>

 <p>Megumin forcibly pushed the poster towards Aqua and I, pointing at the bounty.</p>

 <p>But even so…</p>

 <p>“Hey, have you really thought this through? We’re a party that couldn’t even take down a giant toad cleanly. How are we supposed to beat a boss-level opponent?”</p>

 <p>Byakko are usually one of the tough bosses that appears near the end in video games and manga and the like.</p>

 <p>No matter how you look at it, it’s not an opponent suited for fledgling adventurers like us.</p>

 <p>“I’ve already thought about that. The white tiger is bigger than a normal tiger, right? A bigger target is easier for my spell to hit.”</p>

 <p>Hearing that, Darkness put a hand on her chin.</p>

 <p>“Hmm… No matter how big it is, it’s still a tiger without armor. If Megumin lands a direct hit with Explosion, it probably won’t survive.”</p>

 <p>Well, I’m very well aware of the power of Explosion, but…</p>

 <p>If we can have Darkness hold it at bay in order for Megumin to take it down with an explosion, we might actually be able to win.</p>

 <p>That thing had a two hundred million eris bounty on its head. We could clear our debts and still have money left over.</p>

 <p>“Hmm… but, well… two hundred million…”</p>

 <p>“See!? This is why you’re naive! I’m not going! What are you thinking, going after a divine beast!? Darkness, Megumin—stop egging on this weak-willed man who gets lured around by money!”</p>

 <p>The source of all my debts revealed her true nature and shouted.</p>

 <p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

 <p>“Sob… sob… I said I didn’t want to come…”</p>

 <p>“That goes for me too. I would rather not be here, but this is important. I’d rather wipe away the debt that someone created for us as soon as possible!”</p>

 <p>Dragging Aqua—who’d been crying the whole time—along with us, we arrived at the mountains west of Axel.</p>

 <p>Looking up at the verdant mountains, Megumin suggested a compromise to Aqua.</p>

 <p>“Well, we’ll just give it a shot. We’ll run away the moment it seems like it’s unwinnable. The white tiger usually only lives in the depths of the mountains, but fortunately, it’s been spotted around here recently, so there’s no need to trek deep inside. We can just wait for it out here.”</p>

 <p>“True, if we fight around here, it’d be easy to run back to Axel if anything untoward happens. Don’t worry, Aqua. I’ll properly protect you.”</p>

 <p>Barely convinced by the two of them, Aqua followed us while nervously scanning our surroundings.</p>

 <p>Still, a byakko, huh?</p>

 <p>Ignoring the recent increase in sightings, it’s supposedly a rarely seen monster, so we’ll just keep watch out here for a while. If it doesn’t show up, we’ll just drop the whole thing and head back home.</p>

 <p>Just as I was entertaining that naive thought,</p>

 <p>A loud rustling came from the woods in front of me.</p>

 <p>“Is it a rookie killer…?”</p>

 <p>A large black-furred feline with huge fangs—the natural enemy of newbie adventurers—appeared in front of us.</p>

 <p>“Why would a rookie killer appear in this place!? I can’t use Explosion when it’s this close!”</p>

 <p>“Megumin, Aqua, stay back! Make sure you stay behind me!”</p>

 <p>“Aqua, hurry up and give Darkness some buffs! Megumin, you should prepare to cast your Explosion! With a rookie killer here, it wouldn’t be surprising for there to be a few other monsters around us as well.”</p>

 <p>“Hey, why is Kazuma moving to the back!? You get up front too! Just Darkness alone wouldn’t be able to fend it off!”</p>

 <p>Having been caught completely off guard by the sudden appearance of the rookie killer, we hastily got into a combat formation.</p>

 <p>However, uncharacteristically, it didn’t take the opportunity to strike.</p>

 <p>It simply stared directly at us.</p>

 <p>“… Why isn’t it attacking?”</p>

 <p>“I-I wonder why… Maybe it’s scared of us? I mean, we did take down a Demon King’s General. Maybe its instincts are telling it it can’t win.”</p>

 <p>“It’d be nice if that were the case, but that doesn’t look like fear. It feels more like it’s judging us…”</p>

 <p>While it watched us whispering among ourselves, the rookie killer suddenly roared toward the distance.</p>

 <p>We instinctively took up a guard position, and before long, a similar roar could be heard coming from the depths of the mountains.</p>

 <p>“Wait, rookie killers hunt in packs!? One is bad enough! There’s no way we can win if a whole pack comes at us!”</p>

 <p>“Let’s run! We’ll let them off today!”</p>

 <p>“That’s why I said we shouldn’t come here!”</p>

 <p>“… ”</p>

 <p>“Hey, Darkness, don’t smile like that all by yourself!”</p>

 <p>Without taking my eyes off that rookie killer, I slowly started backing away.</p>

 <p>“Okay, listen up. Most carnivores like rookie killers will instinctively chase you the moment you turn your back. But if we drag this out, it’ll slowly close the distance and pounce once it’s in range. We wait for an opening, then run all at once. If our timing is even a little off, we’re done for. If we all run together, it shouldn’t chase.”</p>

 <p>“We’ll run on five, got it? On five. Don’t go early.”</p>

 <p>“Okay. Trust me.”</p>

 <p>After confirming the responses of the two, Darkness, who was still staring down the rookie killer, started counting.</p>

 <p>“Right, so I’ll start. One… Two…”</p>

 <p>“Three!”</p>

 <p>The moment we reached three, all of us, other than Darkness, immediately bolted for it.</p>

 <p>“Four… Ah! W-Wait for me!”</p>

 <p>As Darkness chased after us with tears in her eyes, the other two who were trailing behind me started raising a fuss…</p>

 <p>“I knew this would happen! Leaving the easily tricked Darkness aside, there’s no way such lies can escape my crimson eyes! It’s definitely not because I wanted to run away on my own!”</p>

 <p>“Kazuma, you liar! By the way, that’s the same for me too! It’s not because I wanted to run away on my own. Just like Megumin, there’s no way any lies can escape my divine gaze!”</p>

 <p>And dumped all the blame on me.</p>

 <p>“W-Wait!… The armour is heavy…! Still, that guy isn’t chasing after us!”</p>

 <p>Darkness shouted between breaths.</p>

 <p>“Eh?” x3</p>

 <p>We turned back around after hearing that, and true enough, the rookie killer hasn’t moved an inch from where it started.</p>

 <p><strong>Part 3</strong></p>

 <p>Once again, the four of us returned to where the rookie killer was.</p>

 <p>“What is it doing? Is it hungry? I’ve got a bit of the dried squid we just ordered in my pocket. Would it leave if I feed it that?”</p>

 <p>“If it were hungry, it would’ve attacked. And there was that roar earlier. Do rookie killers usually behave like th—”</p>

 <p>Before I could finish my sentence.</p>

 <p>Something else emerged from the trees.</p>

 <p>Seeing that, Darkness, standing at the head of our party, muttered.</p>

 <p>“How beautiful…”</p>

 <p>What appeared in front of us was a gigantic tiger with pure white fur.</p>

 <p>The byakko we’d come here to find.</p>

 <p>“M-Megumin! The one you were after is here!”</p>

 <p>“T-T-Taste my Explosion magic…!”</p>

 <p>“Megumin, hurry up! That look in its eyes is pure predator! Take it down!”</p>

 <p>“You little…! Didn’t you say a byakko was a divine beast or something earlier!? It’s the same kind of divine creature as you, right? Calm it down!”</p>

 <p>The sudden appearance of the byakko and its heavy boss-like aura threw us into a panic.</p>

 <p>As Megumin hastily started chanting her spell, Darkness—who had sheathed her weapon—smiled at the byakko.</p>

 <p>“It’s fine. I don’t sense any hostility from it, and there’s intelligence in its eyes. Besides, the rookie killer still hasn’t moved. The byakko must have given it instructions.”</p>

 <p>After hearing such unbelievable words, I took another close look at the byakko.</p>

 <p>Its pure white fur shone in the afternoon sun, giving it breathtaking beauty—and a faintly divine aura.</p>

 <p>And just as Darkness said, I can sense the gleam of intelligence from its eyes.</p>

 <p>Darkness spread her arms and spoke to the byakko in a gentle, soothing voice…</p>

 <p>“I’m ashamed I even considered harming such a beautiful animal… See, there’s nothing to be afraid o—”</p>

 <p>And at that very instant, she was sent flying with a swipe of the byakko’s claws.</p>

 <p>“It seems totally ready for a fight! Megumin, is your spell not ready yet!?”</p>

 <p>“It’s ready to go off at any time! That’s just a giant cat… a giant… a white tiger!”</p>

 <p>“Good! Aqua, hurry up and throw some buffs on Darkness… Hey, don’t you dare run at such a time!”</p>

 <p>Sensing the concentration of mana around Megumin, the rookie killer darted back into the bush, but the byakko didn’t make a single move at all.</p>

 <p>“With this, the title of Byakko Slayer will be mine! Eat this! My strongest spell—Explosion!”</p>

 <p>The shockwave from the explosion sent Aqua sprawling as she tried to flee, and I quickly hit the dirt too to avoid the worst of it.</p>

 <p>Once it passed, all that remained was a giant crater. There wasn’t a trace of the byakko, and the rookie killer that had vanished earlier was nowhere to be seen either.</p>

 <p>I moved over to Megumin and started scanning the surroundings for the byakko.</p>

 <p>“… Did you get it?”</p>

 <p>Darkness, scanning her surroundings just like me, said the one thing you should never say in these types of situations.</p>

 <p>“In the end, it’s still just a beast. I can’t believe two hundred million eris was that easy. Hey, Kazuma—let’s head back! We can wipe out our debts and still have a little fortune left, so we can take it easy for a few days!”</p>

 <p>And of course, Aqua just had to jinx it.</p>

 <p>I shouted towards her.</p>

 <p>“No, no, no—the poster said, ’To receive the full reward, you must provide the byakko’s fur.‘ But there’s not even a trace of it left…”</p>

 <p>I suddenly stiffened up.</p>

 <p>My Enemy Detection skill was screaming that something was behind me.</p>

 <p>I cautiously turned around…</p>

 <p>“I don’t know if you can understand me, but just in case: I was against hunting a byakko from the start. I really like cats, okay? Not that I’m saying tigers and cats are the same thing or anything.”</p>

 <p>Facing down the byakko who suddenly appeared behind me, I raised both my hands and said.</p>

 <p>How the hell did it get behind us so quickly!?</p>

 <p>“I also told them harming a divine beast would bring divine punishment, but these idiots are blinded by greed and fame and want your fur no matter what. I only came along to stop them…”</p>

 <p>“….”</p>

 <p>It ignored us—and Megumin, playing dead beside me—and moved closer to Aqua.</p>

 <p>“Hey, why are you coming closer to me!? I didn’t do anything! You’ve got the wrong idea! We’re both divine creatures—can’t we just get along…? Huh?”</p>

 <p>As Aqua covered her face and started spinning all kinds of excuses, the byakko removed something from its mouth and pushed it over to Aqua.</p>

 <p>Aqua accepted it with a dumbfounded look. The byakko immediately turned around and vanished into the woods.</p>

 <p>Darkness rushed over to Aqua’s side and looked at what was in her hand.</p>

 <p>“… The byakko’s cub…?”</p>

 <p>—On the path back to Axel.</p>

 <p>“Hey, even if you give me this child, I’m not quite sure what I can do with it.”</p>

 <p>Aqua kept the bundle of fur in her arms, constantly pumping it full of recovery magic.</p>

 <p>The little byakko was so weak it looked like it might die at any moment.</p>

 <p>“Still, isn’t this great for you, Megumin? If this kid really does breathe its last, you’ll be able to gain the title of byakko killer just like you originally wanted.”</p>

 <p>“W-Wait a second, this isn’t my fault, right? This kid didn’t end up like this because he got caught in my Explosion, did he?”</p>

 <p>I regarded Megumin who seemed to be working herself into a panic, but just before I could say something…</p>

 <p>“I know you always do unnecessary things, but the reason this kid is so weak is because he doesn’t have enough divine essence. A divine beast like a byakko builds that essence by feeding from its mother, but I couldn’t detect much divine essence in the mother. She probably used most of it giving birth, and now she’s wandering around looking for someone with powerful divine energy—like me.”</p>

 <p>Aqua declared, confidently.</p>

 <p>“So it’s looking for a nanny because she ran out of divine essence? Considering you used to fight the horses in the stable for sleeping space, is he really going to gain any divine essence from being with you?”</p>

 <p>“You’ll get divine punishment if you continue saying such baseless things! Look at how peaceful it’s sleeping after receiving my divine essence.”</p>

 <p>“… Isn’t he peeing himself?”</p>

 <p>Darkness restrained Aqua as she tried to throw the furball away after her robe got stained, then gazed at the white tiger’s sleeping face and said,</p>

 <p>“Well, I get that Aqua can emit divine essence from being a priest, but what should we do about this kid?”</p>

 <p>“Let’s keep it.”</p>

 <p>Aqua, picking up the byakko that she just tried to throw away a while ago, said.</p>

 <p>“His mother gave up her parental rights, which means those rights are mine now. Sure, I’d prefer to raise a dragon, but a divine beast works too. I’ll raise him to be loyal to me and turn him into a trump card against the Demon King.”</p>

 <p>“You can’t even take care of yourself properly, and yet you still want to keep a pet?”</p>

 <p><strong>Part 4</strong></p>

 <p>Staring intently at the bundle of fur in Aqua’s hands, the guild receptionist asked cautiously,</p>

 <p>“Uh… Well, we can buy it, but… um…”</p>

 <p>After returning to Axel, we headed back to the adventurer’s guild.</p>

 <p>“Fiend! Kazuma, you fiend! How can you sell such a cute animal to be turned into a fur coat or something!? Did you leave your conscience behind in your mother’s womb!?”</p>

 <p>After we unexpectedly ended up with a baby byakko, I racked my brain for a way to make money out of the whole mess and asked if they’d accept the fur of an immature byakko.</p>

 <p>“You’re an adventurer, so quit saying such naive things! This is a monster, you know!? No matter how cute he is, he’s still a monster’s cub! I’d rather not do this either, but we don’t have a choice! The whole ‘byakkos don’t harm humans’ thing is just a rumor! If we believe it and let him go, what are you going to do if he hurts someone once he grows up!?”</p>

 <p>I argued with Aqua who was holding the tiger tightly against her chest.</p>

 <p>“This man, you even said that taking a harmless life is against your creed and what not, but you immediately change your tune the moment money is involved.”</p>

 <p>“Megumin, take a good look! This is the expression of a man who’s blinded by money!”</p>

 <p>The peanut gallery is really loud today.</p>

 <p>Ignoring the two of them who were whispering to each other behind my back, I snatched the byakko away from Aqua’s grasp.</p>

 <p>“And have you given any thought to how long it’ll take before this kitten can help in a fight!? Divine beasts probably live for over a hundred years, right!? It’ll take at least a decade or two before he fully grows up!”</p>

 <p>“But… But…!”</p>

 <p>Dodging Aqua’s attempts at snatching it back, I placed the byakko on the counter.</p>

 <p>“So please buy him. How much is he worth, anyway?”</p>

 <p>“D-Do you really want to sell him? Um… I’d guess he’s worth about ten million eris…”</p>

 <p>The receptionist hesitantly said as she saw the byakko curled up into a ball on her counter.</p>

 <p>As expected of a byakko. Even a cub is worth ten million eris.</p>

 <p>It might not be able to clear away all of my debts, but this will give me enough money to make it through the winter. Plus…</p>

 <p>“Nyaa~ Nyaa~”</p>

 <p>Seeming quite a bit livelier after receiving Aqua’s divine essence, the byakko looked up at me and repeatedly mewed.</p>

 <p>Additionally, I could feel Aqua’s intense gaze on the back of my head.</p>

 <p>“Ooh… it’s so soft…”</p>

 <p>The receptionist ran her hand through its fur and shivered in response.</p>

 <p>“We already have my familiar living with us, so even if there are two of them, it won’t add that much extra work. Why don’t we take him in?”</p>

 <p>Ignoring Megumin who was saying such things, and Aqua who was still staring at me, I repeatedly told myself.</p>

 <p>Steel yourself, Kazuma Satou! Sure, I like cats, but that’s a tiger!</p>

 <p>“W-Well, I can understand where you’re coming from with all of that debt hanging over your head. And as an adventurer, I feel the same way about not letting a monster go free. Raising a monster isn’t something that should be praised. Let’s leave the decision to Kazuma.”</p>

 <p>Despite saying that, Darkness was staring intently at the byakko with a gentle expression.</p>

 <p>“Nyaa~! Nyaa~! Nyaa~!”</p>

 <p>Even Darkness seems to have fallen for its charms, but I am not cut from the same cloth as these three!</p>

 <p>No matter how much it attempts to appeal to me, I won’t falter!</p>

 <p>“Do we have enough sand for the litter box? Oh, and prepare a box for him to sleep in. And a blanket, too.”</p>

 <p>“We can just use some of the sand that we use for Chomusuke. As for the box, I’ll go ask the owner of the nearby alcohol shop for one.”</p>

 <p>On the way home.</p>

 <p>After falling for his charms after all, I started preparing what we’d need to keep the byakko.</p>

 <p>Well, it’s a baby byakko, after all. It should grow up to be pretty strong in the future.</p>

 <p>I might not know how much time and food it would take before it grows up, but looking at it positively…</p>

 <p>“I’m home!”</p>

 <p>Aqua immediately ran to her spot by the fireplace the moment the door opened.</p>

 <p>The byakko, held in her arms, stared intently at a point in the ceiling.</p>

 <p>Darkness went off to the kitchen to brew some tea, and Megumin, after getting off my back, headed over to the sofa and flopped onto it.</p>

 <p>“It’s really staring! Maybe he can see things he’s not supposed to? He is a divine beast, after all.”</p>

 <p>Megumin said as she turned onto her back and followed the byakko’s gaze.</p>

 <p>Hearing that sort of thing will make it really hard to sleep at night, so please cut it out.</p>

 <p>“He’s staring at the stray ghost that lives in this mansion. I’ve mentioned it before, haven’t I? The ghost of a young noble girl is here. She’s been floating around like a jellyfish this whole time, so he probably got curious.”</p>

 <p>“You know, I’ve been thinking this for a while now, but if there’s really something like that living here, she should really come and talk to me at least once. It doesn’t feel like this place is haunted at all.”</p>

 <p>… Just then, Darkness, who was supposed to be preparing tea in the kitchen, came back bearing a handful of items and an uncertain expression.</p>

 <p>“S-So, what should we name him? He’s really hugging that warm milk bottle. I know he mainly subsists on divine essence, but is it okay to give him some milk?”</p>

 <p>The one who just said that an adventurer shouldn’t let a monster go free and what not is now the one fawning over the monster the most.</p>

 <p><strong>Part 5</strong></p>

 <p>“This kid’s name is Jake Wild. His full name is Wolfgang D. Jake Wild—Jake for short.”</p>

 <p>The next morning, Aqua, cradling the byakko in her arms, gave us that introduction the moment we met.</p>

 <p>What a uselessly grandiose name.</p>

 <p>“I’ve also been thinking of a name for him.”</p>

 <p>“No, you definitely can’t name him! You’re going to name him something weird like Megumegu or Minmin or something, right?”</p>

 <p>“Hey, can you stop making fun of my name?”</p>

 <p>Off to the side as the two of them argued first thing in the morning, Darkness happily changed the sand in the litter box.</p>

 <p>“Still, it does look far more energetic compared to yesterday.”</p>

 <p>It looked like it was on the verge of death yesterday, but it’s certainly far more energetic now.</p>

 <p>“Yeah, at this rate, it’ll be able to live on its own after another week or so.”</p>

 <p>According to Aqua, it only needs to be constantly infused with divine energy when it’s a newborn. Once that period is over, it can be raised by anyone.</p>

 <p>It’s been about a week since then, and the white tiger cub has become full of energy.</p>

 <p>“All right, I’m not raising you as a pet for fun. Starting today, you’re going through my Spartan-style training regimen so you’ll become my trump card against the Demon King!”</p>

 <p>Aqua struck an imposing posture as she said that to Jake, who was sleeping in the middle of the courtyard.</p>

 <p>“Nyaa~”</p>

 <p>“It’s not nyaa, your answer should be ’Yes!’”</p>

 <p>“Nyaa~ Nyaa~”</p>

 <p>Jake ignored those stupid words and wandered over to Aqua.</p>

 <p>“No, it’s not lunchtime yet… Ah, no—don’t bite my robe! That’s an extremely important divine treasure!… Aaaaah! No, you can’t take that! Come back!”</p>

 <p>After Jake made away with Aqua’s sash, she dropped any pretense of her imposing persona to chase after it.</p>

 <p>It always feels like something is wrong to have her chase after a cat like that.</p>

 <p>The two of them played tag all over the courtyard until Jake fell asleep.</p>

 <p>“-Jake, no, you can’t get together with that kid. There’s an evil aura surrounding her. I don’t like her at all.”</p>

 <p>—The next day.</p>

 <p>Aqua spoke to Jake as it was playing around with Chomusuke.</p>

 <p>“To think that he would be able to go toe to toe with my familiar, this Jake is pretty skilled too. Isn’t he?”</p>

 <p>“Ahh, how cute… Say, Aqua, Megumin, can we leave those two alone for a while?”</p>

 <p>Under the gazes of the three, Jake and Chomusuke pushed each other down and play fought in front of the fireplace.</p>

 <p>“Jake, let her have a taste of the God Blow that I taught you yesterday! Let that evil furball know the difference in power between the two of you and bring her under your heel!”</p>

 <p>Aqua cheered, but at that instant, the two of them seemed like they tried themselves out and curled up into a ball to take a nap.</p>

 <p>Seeing that, Darkness looked like she wanted to pet them but was afraid of waking them up, so she held her hand.</p>

 <p>Aqua on the other hand had no such reservations and hastily picked up Jake.</p>

 <p>“Why aren’t you listening to me? I won’t let you slack off today! Come on, wake up! It’s time for your training! Even if you cry and beg, I won’t — Aaaaah!”</p>

 <p>“… Looks like he forgot where the litter box is.”</p>

 <p>“Why does he always do this on me!? Uuu… Uuu… Jake, I’m begging you—please remember where the litter box is!”</p>

 <p>Aqua, crying and pleading with the newborn tiger, rushed to the bathroom.</p>

 <p>—That night.</p>

 <p>“Hey, Jake, that robe is a very important item. It’s not your blanket. I have your blanket right here, so can you please give it back?”</p>

 <p>Having snatched away the hagoromo that Aqua’s been calling a divine treasure, Jake is currently taking a nap on top of it.</p>

 <p>“He really is carefree. That pet of yours that you’ve raised sure is quite unreasonable.”</p>

 <p>“We just haven’t learned to communicate yet! I’ll be sleeping here tonight! I want him to think I’m his mother!”</p>

 <p>Saying that, she laid down in front of the fireplace and hugged the box that Jake was sleeping in.</p>

 <p>Well, if she wants to do that, there’s no harm in letting her do so.</p>

 <p>“Ah, you haven’t used the litter box yet, have you? My robe might be able to purify liquids, but you’ll still get divine punishment for that. I won’t let you get away with it this time! Apologize properly!”</p>

 <p>Her voice could be heard throughout the entire mansion.</p>

 <p>—After such days continued on for several weeks, on a certain afternoon.</p>

 <p>“Jake, it’s a very beautiful day today, so I understand why you might want to take a nap, but it’s about time you should start listening to me! You should be ready to start taking combat lessons now!”</p>

 <p>Aqua proclaimed as she carried Jake in her arms in the courtyard.</p>

 <p>“Seriously, who cares about combat training and defeating the Demon King and whatnot? As a cat lover, I’d be happy just spending the days like this.”</p>

 <p>“Well, I’m not happy at all! This kid still hasn’t remembered where he’s supposed to use the litter box! And he doesn’t listen to me! A divine beast should be more sensible, but he’s still wetting the bed every day!”</p>

 <p>Wetting his bed, huh…</p>

 <p>“Say, you know, I’ve heard that children will wet their bed when they feel lonely. Is this kid lonely because he can’t see his mother?”</p>

 <p>“… This kid has already caused me so much trouble. Will such a selfish and fickle cat really not be able to forget its birth mother? Seriously, what a fickle child.”</p>

 <p>“Well, he’s a tiger—what do you want me to say? He’ll get used to it eventually. When he stops wetting the bed, that’ll mean he finally recognized you as his mother.”</p>

 <p>I muttered while sprawled out on the grass, then Aqua shot back,</p>

 <p>“Ah, wait, doesn’t that mean that he’ll continue defiling my divine treasure!? Don’t even joke about that! Hey, Jake, just what do you think the divine treasure of a goddess is!? I know that I’ve been spoiling you all this time, but if you continue doing that, I’ll have to seriously punish you!”</p>

 <p>—In the mountains to the west of Axel.</p>

 <p>“Hey, is this really fine?”</p>

 <p>We were currently heading off towards where we first met the byakko with Jake in tow.</p>

 <p>“I already said it’s fine. I don’t need some stupid kid who can’t even find the litter box. He doesn’t listen to a word I say. I knew it—raising a dragon would’ve been better. Hey, did you hear that, Jake? We might be going our separate ways today, but I’m happy as can be.”</p>

 <p>Aqua, leading our party, said that while holding Jake tightly against her chest.</p>

 <p>“… But still, Aqua, even if we go back to the same spot, his birth mother might not be in the same place. I wouldn’t mind continuing to raise it and turning it into another one of my familiars.”</p>

 <p>Having grown attached to him in the short time they spent together, Megumin and Darkness are both trying to talk Aqua out of it.</p>

 <p>However…</p>

 <p>“She’ll definitely be waiting there. It’s my goddess intuition.”</p>

 <p>Hearing Aqua say that, the two had no choice but to follow along in silence.</p>

 <p>—And thus.</p>

 <p>“See, it’s just like I said, right?”</p>

 <p>How long had she been waiting there? The same byakko we’d met before was lying motionless with her eyes closed.</p>

 <p>I don’t know why she was so sure, but she must’ve known Aqua would bring her cub back.</p>

 <p>As Aqua approached it bearing Jake in her arms, the byakko opened its eyes.</p>

 <p>Under our gaze, Aqua crouched down and gently placed Jake on the ground.</p>

 <p>“Now, now, hurry up and go home.”</p>

 <p>Jake looked up at Aqua who harshly said such things, but remained motionless.</p>

 <p>“… What’s wrong? Are you worried about what I said earlier? Just so you know, the ‘dragons are better than tigers’ bit was a joke. If you have any affection left for me, go attack the Demon King’s army once you grow up.”</p>

 <p>Aqua turned her back, and Jake playfully bit down on the sash of her robe.</p>

 <p>Seeing that, Aqua couldn’t hold back anymore and tightly hugged it against her chest.</p>

 <p>It seems like this was too much for Megumin and Darkness, for they turned away.</p>

 <p>And the mother byakko that was silently observing them from the side slowly approached the two.</p>

 <p>“Now, goodbye, Jake… Hey, Jake, it’s about time you let go of my robe… No, this isn’t your blanket. Ah, ouch! Jake, don’t extend your claws! That hurts!”</p>

 <p>Seeing Jake’s unwillingness to let go of Aqua, the mother byakko came to a stop.</p>

 <p>And gently lifted Aqua by her collar with its mouth before darting off.</p>

 <p>“Aaah! Kazuma! Kazuma!”</p>

 <p>“That idiot! Don’t get taken away too!”</p>

 <p>“Aqua! H-Hold on! Please find a way to escape!”</p>

 <p>“Hold it! Where do you intend on taking Aqua to!?”</p>

 <p>A byakko is rumoured to be the fastest creature in this world.</p>

 <p>Needless to say, it’s not something that we can catch up with.</p>

 <p>—Three days later.</p>

 <p>Covered in the byakko’s white fur, Aqua came back looking haggard and muttered,</p>

 <p>“If I ever get a pet in the future, I think I’ll get a dragon…”</p>

 <p>“O-Oh…”</p>
