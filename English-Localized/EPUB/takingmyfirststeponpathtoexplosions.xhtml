  <p>Under her hood, the big-breasted lady twitched.</p>

  <p>“Wha… what did you say?”</p>

  <p>“I said, please teach me that spell.”</p>

  <p>I repeated myself to the lady in the hood.</p>

  <p>She looked more troubled than when I told her I wanted to conquer the world.</p>

  <p>More troubled than when I asked how to make my chest bigger.</p>

  <p>And even more troubled than when I asked her to make me the Demon King.</p>

  <p>“Uh, that spell… I told you before, didn’t I? I really don’t recommend you learn it.”</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>“Fine, then can you at least teach me how to catch crayfish? I want something for dinner.”</p>

  <p>“D-Don’t look at me like that! I can teach you if you really insist, I just… I really don’t want to. Nothing good comes from it…”</p>

  <p>I stared at the flustered lady in front of me.</p>

  <p>“What was the spell you just used?”</p>

  <p>“That spell? It’s called Explosion. The strongest spell there is.”</p>

  <p>The strongest!</p>

  <p>“It’s the most powerful destructive force known to humankind. God or devil, it doesn’t matter. Explosion is the ultimate offensive spell. It can destroy anything in the world.”</p>

  <p>The ultimate!</p>

  <p>“But learning it costs an enormous amount of skill points. And even if you learn it, you won’t be able to cast it without a massive amount of mana. Even if you can cast it, you’ll be too drained to move afterward… Hey. Are you listening to me?”</p>

  <p>“Not even a little. Please teach me that spell. I want to cast Explosion.”</p>

  <p>I grabbed the hem of her robe and started shaking her.</p>

  <p>“How did this happen… I just wanted to thank her… Did I ruin her life instead…?”</p>

  <p>She let out a long, tired sigh.</p>

  <p>—The next day—</p>

  <p>She’d asked for a day of rest after casting Explosion, so today was the day she’d promised to teach it to me.</p>

  <p>“Young lady, are you sure you don’t want to reconsider?”</p>

  <p>We met at the tomb, and she led me to an empty plain far from the village.</p>

  <p>“No. The only spell I want to learn is Explosion.”</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>“Fine. I’m only teaching you the spell. It’ll take about ten years to master, so you’ll probably give up somewhere along the way.”</p>

  <p>“Never! I’ll learn it for sure! Just you watch!”</p>

  <p>She frowned at my answer, but she started reciting the Explosion chant anyway —slowly, like she was afraid I’d trip over my own tongue.</p>

  <p>“All right. That’s the chant for Explosion. First, let’s see if you can memorize—”</p>

  <p>Before she could finish, I flicked my cloak and—</p>

  <p>“Megumin, the true crimson god of destruction, hereby commands! By my authority, manifest the power to reduce all creation to ash before me!”</p>

  <p>“What kind of chant is that?! What’s with the god of destruction and authority and whatever else?! I definitely didn’t teach you any of that!”</p>

  <p>And that’s how I ended up learning magic from a hooded lady whose name I still didn’t even know—</p>

  <p>“Hey, young lady, I really don’t think you should add your own lines to the chant when you cast magic. Your lines sound cool, but that isn’t Explosion anymore.”</p>

  <p>“I’m a Crimson Demon. Of course I want to add a little Crimson Demon flair.”</p>

  <p>She spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of improving the chant.</p>

  <p>“Young lady, don’t strike a pose. If you do that, the spell will go flying who-knows-where.”</p>

  <p>“The shoemaker’s son said a Crimson Demon who wins without striking a pose is no true Crimson Demon.”</p>

  <p>“That boy has been hit in the head. Don’t listen to him. Please don’t grow up to be like him.”</p>

  <p>She also corrected my posture while I channeled mana.</p>

  <p>“Look, this is the advanced spell ‘Inferno’! It creates a huge blaze and incinerates everything around it. What do you think? Want to learn this instead?”</p>

  <p>“Not at all. Anyway, hurry up and cast Explosion! I want to see today’s Explosion!”</p>

  <p>“Young lady, Explosion isn’t a firework. Even if you learn it, you can’t just set it off whenever you feel like it.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, I can.”</p>

  <p>More than once, she looked like she was on the verge of tears as she tried to pry me away from Explosion.</p>

  <p>“Young lady, advanced magic and teleportation are a potent combination. You can handle most enemies that way.”</p>

  <p>“Explosion!”</p>

  <p>“If you use Light of Saber, you can cut through anything, as long as you have enough mana…”</p>

  <p>“Explosion!”</p>

  <p>“Okay, then instead of Explosion, how about Blast or Detonate? They’re both strong spells in their own right…”</p>

  <p>“Explosion!”</p>

  <p>“I’m begging you. Please listen to me!”</p>

  <p>Eventually, she snapped and burst into tears while I practiced my cool lines.</p>

  <p>Afterward.</p>

  <p>“I don’t want to learn anything other than Explosion! I don’t care how many years it takes. Even if I have to practice until I’m an old lady, I won’t give up until I learn it.”</p>

  <p>“Seriously, what is it about Explosion that’s made you this obsessed?”</p>

  <p>I ignored her question and handed her a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>“Please use this chant for today’s Explosion.”</p>

  <p>“…You changed it again? A spell’s invocation isn’t for making it stronger. It’s for controlling it. If you keep changing it on a whim… sigh…”</p>

  <p>The hooded lady covered her face with one hand after she read what I’d written.</p>

  <p>In the end, though, she gave in and used my chant anyway—</p>

  <p>“Explosion!”</p>

  <p>Another crater appeared in the field, which had already become pockmarked with craters over the last few days.</p>

  <p>“What the—? How did it suddenly get stronger?!”</p>

  <p>She looked genuinely flustered as she stared at the results of her own spell.</p>

  <p>“Obviously a cooler chant makes the spell stronger.”</p>

  <p>“Magic isn’t that simple! …Okay, I get it —you’re a genius— but please don’t go modifying spells like that from now on, all right?”</p>

  <p>“No.”</p>

  <p>Once again, she looked like she was about to cry.</p>

  <p>She was a very beautiful lady, but for some reason, I think I’d only ever seen her when she was on the verge of tears.</p>

  <p>“Before we start training for real, there’s something I want to show you. But it’s big and scary, and you’re a kid, so I shouldn’t force you to come along. Do you want to?”</p>

  <p>“My mom’s really scary, so it’s fine.”</p>

  <p>She actually laughed for once.</p>

  <p>“The thing I’m talking about is several times scarier than your mother, you know?”</p>

  <p>“Really?! When my dad went out to borrow money for his weird inventions, my mom froze him from the head down and threw him into the forest while he cried. It’s scarier than that?!”</p>

  <p>“…Oh, right. Your mother’s a Crimson Demon too. If she’s anything like you, she’s probably just as scary as that.”</p>

  <p>Something as scary as Mom…</p>

  <p>“Are we going to see the Demon King? Or an evil god?”</p>

  <p>“Just how scary is your mother? …Also, why are your eyes glowing? Are you seriously interested in the Demon King or evil gods?”</p>

  <p>She said that with a sly smile, and I nodded.</p>

  <p>“After I defeat the Demon King, I’ll take his title and become the next Demon King!”</p>

  <p>“You can’t do that! The Demon King is the king of all demonkind! It’s not something you can just become by beating the current one!”</p>

  <p>After that, she made a strange, knowing face.</p>

  <p>“…Well, Demon King aside, if we’re talking about evil gods, you might have already met one without realizing it.”</p>

  <p>She said it with a strange smile playing on her lips.</p>

  <p>“That’s impossible. If an evil god got anywhere near the village, the villagers would’ve captured it, sealed it away, and turned it into a tourist attraction.”</p>

  <p>“I think the Crimson Demons should stop treating divine beings like toys!”</p>

  <p>Deep in the forest on the outskirts of the village.</p>

  <p>This area was usually off-limits to me, since it was packed with dangerous monsters.</p>

  <p>After she brought me out here…</p>

  <p>“Young lady, I think we should go back! This is my fault, so please listen to me!”</p>

  <p>“A one-strike bear’s liver and stomach are worth a ton of money! I don’t know why they’re so afraid of us, but this is a perfect opportunity! If we catch one, we can eat it for dinner!”</p>

  <p>We ended up chasing a pack of cowardly one-strike bears that were running from us in sheer terror for some reason.</p>

  <p>I’d been eating nothing but crayfish for a while, so the idea of having a different kind of meat for dinner sounded amazing.</p>

  <p>“Wait! I only brought you here because I wanted to show you that advanced magic is much better for dealing with dangerous monsters! I didn’t come here to hunt one-strike bears!”</p>

  <p>“No problem. I don’t feel like I’ll lose to anyone right now. I’m sure my powers as the god of destruction will awaken in the heat of battle!”</p>

  <p>“How are the Crimson Demons so… Are they like this from the moment they’re born…?”</p>

  <p>She heaved a deep sigh and started chanting.</p>

  <p>“Freeze Gust!”</p>

  <p>A burst of white powder shot from her hands and enveloped the one-strike bears, freezing them in place.</p>

  <p>“Oh! If we bring this back, we can turn it into a new attraction for the village.”</p>

  <p>“No way! This is just to show you there are other spells —better, stronger spells— out there!”</p>

  <p>Looking at the frozen pack of one-strike bears, helplessly whining, she let out a rare smile.</p>

  <p>“That was intermediate magic: Freeze Gust. See? With enough mana, even intermediate spells can be powerful. It takes a lot less mana than Explosion. If you use advanced and intermediate magic strategically, I’m sure you could become one of the best mages…”</p>

  <p>Her voice went sharp. “Young lady, what are you doing?!”</p>

  <p>She hurried in front of me as I approached the frozen bears with a big stick.</p>

  <p>“It’s a rare chance to have a whole herd of high-level monsters lying helpless. I’m going to finish them off and earn experience points. People in the village do this all the time to level up. They freeze monsters like this, then take them out. Some people even raise monsters just for it.”</p>

  <p>“What in the world?! D-do the Crimson Demons have any decency at all?!”</p>

  <p>Those happy days continued for quite a while.</p>

  <p>But before long, it seemed like she finally started to get restless.</p>

  <p>“Young lady, can I ask you something?”</p>

  <p>“What is it? I’m not telling you where the crayfish nest is, so don’t ask.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry, I don’t want to know that. …Say, Crimson Demons get their adventurer cards made when they’re born, right? Let me see yours.”</p>

  <p>The moment she said that, I tried to hide the card I kept in my robe pocket.</p>

  <p>She sighed again.</p>

  <p>“I knew it. Explosion already showed up in your learnable skills, didn’t it?”</p>

  <p>“No. I’m a slow learner, so I need a lot more time before I can learn something like that.”</p>

  <p>She raised a hand toward me.</p>

  <p>“Paralyze.”</p>

  <p>When she finished chanting, I realized I couldn’t move at all.</p>

  <p>“W-What are you doing?! Are you trying to do something to me while I can’t move?! I’ll call for help when I get back to the village! And when I get back, I’m telling my mom and dad a big-breasted, yellow-eyed lady kidnapped me! S-stop! Stop!”</p>

  <p>“I just wanted to see your adventurer card! Please don’t tell people about me!”</p>

  <p>I wanted to resist, but I couldn’t move a muscle, so she took my card without any trouble.</p>

  <p>Once she had it, she lifted the spell and started reading in a low voice.</p>

  <p>“Explosion is under learnable skills, all right… Huh? The other spells I showed you are in here too?! How can you call yourself a slow learner? You learned all of these just from seeing them once!”</p>

  <p>When I crossed my arms and looked away, she made a troubled face.</p>

  <p>“Young lady, I still have things I need to do, and places I need to go. Now that I’ve taught you Explosion, it’s about time we part ways.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t wanna! If you leave, I won’t get to see Explosion anymore!”</p>

  <p>At that, she crouched to my eye level.</p>

  <p>“Didn’t you say you’ll learn Explosion for sure? You’ll see it again once you can cast it yourself.”</p>

  <p>She gave me a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>“Then it’s time for us to part. It’s dangerous to go farther from the village, so there’s no need to see me off… I don’t really approve of this, but in the end, it’s your life. I won’t stop you. From here on out, you’ll have to make your own decisions.”</p>

  <p>She said that as she gazed down the road leading out of the village.</p>

  <p>We hadn’t spent that much time together, but I enjoyed every day I spent with her.</p>

  <p>I ate great food, hunted powerful monsters, and saw all kinds of spells.</p>

  <p>So…</p>

  <p>“Okay. It’s time to say goodbye. If the day ever comes when you learn Explosion, I’d really like to see it for myself.”</p>

  <p>“Then don’t forget about me before that day comes.”</p>

  <p>“I-I don’t think I could forget you even if I wanted to. Your unusual name, everything you did, your aptitude for magic… Just seeing you makes my heart thump. Try to live peacefully from now on, okay?”</p>

  <p>The spell I fell in love with… the one she cast for me again and again…</p>

  <p>“My goal is to defeat the Demon King, so I can’t promise I’ll live peacefully, but… I can promise I’ll definitely show you my Explosion. So…”</p>

  <p>As if she already knew what I was about to ask, she gave me a wry smile.</p>

  <p>“Could I please see your Explosion one last time?”</p>

  <p>I’ll definitely show you my Explosion one day—</p>
