  <p>This happened one night when I was out late and heading home.</p>

  <p>“…What’s going on?”</p>

  <p>Even though it was this late, for some reason there was a huge line tucked beside an alley.</p>

  <p>And I recognized a few faces in it.</p>

  <p>Curiosity got the better of me, so I walked over and asked,</p>

  <p>“Uh, excuse me—what’s this line for?”</p>

  <p>“R-Regular! What are you doing out this late?”</p>

  <p>Standing in line were the girls from the shop—the ones who usually take care of me.</p>

  <p>“A-A human! Why’s there a human here at this hour?”</p>

  <p>“Oh no, we’ve been discovered! Are they canceling tonight’s sale?”</p>

  <p>The people in line started making a fuss the second they saw me.</p>

  <p>“N-No, it’s fine. He’s a regular at our shop. He already knows we’re succubi.”<span id="more-688"></span></p>

  <p>At that, the line collectively let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Which meant nobody in this line was human.</p>

  <p>“Well, tonight the shop we’re lined up for is releasing an extremely shocking pinup magazine.”</p>

  <p>An “extremely shocking” pinup magazine?</p>

  <p>“Ever since they announced it, I’ve been counting the days! I’ve been waiting for this!”</p>

  <p>“I-I’ve been praying to the dark gods every day since they announced it…”</p>

  <p>That’s what the two guys at the front of the line were saying.</p>

  <p>Once I paid attention, it was obvious: almost every devil in line looked ridiculously excited.</p>

  <p>Was it really that intense?</p>

  <p>“So… Regular, could you do us a favor and keep what you saw here to yourself?”</p>

  <p>She bowed deeply as she said it.</p>

  <p>“Of course. And actually…I’m getting in line too.”</p>

  <p>“Huh?”</p>

  <p>Every devil present gasped like I’d just announced my own execution.</p>

  <p>“I-Is that really okay? I don’t know if I should be the one to say this, but it’s a really shocking magazine. If a young devil who hasn’t built up any resistance reads it… it might cost them a few of their lives.”</p>

  <p>“Now I want to see it even more.”</p>

  <p>“W-Who is that human? Does he have a death wish?”</p>

  <p>“You don’t know? He’s a regular at our shop, and he’s on friendly terms with Vanir.”</p>

  <p>Murmurs spread through the crowd. For some reason, a few of them were even looking at me like they were jealous.</p>

  <p>Just then—</p>

  <p>“Thank you for lining up at my shop this late, everyone! Please, come in!”</p>

  <p>The one who announced that was Vanir.</p>

  <p>Well, given where we were standing, I’d had a pretty good guess…</p>

  <p>The devils rushed the counter, and anyone who managed to get a copy held it like it was priceless treasure.</p>

  <p>“Hey, hurry up and turn the page! I want to see what’s next!”</p>

  <p>“I-I get it, but calm down! D-Don’t let it get to your head! This page is way too stimulating…”</p>

  <p>The male devils at the front immediately buried themselves in the magazine, like they couldn’t hold back for even one second.</p>

  <p>“Kyaa!”</p>

  <p>“Oh! That’s why I said you’re still too young for this. There goes one of your lives.”</p>

  <p>Maybe she got too worked up after hearing the commotion up front, because the young-looking succubus Aqua once caught sprayed blood from her nose and collapsed.</p>

  <p>Was it really that amazing?</p>

  <p>Just when my hopes were sky-high—</p>

  <p>“Oh, my apologies—they are all sold out. Anyone still in line, please hold onto your tickets and await the next printing.”</p>

  <p>Vanir delivered the most crushing news imaginable.</p>

  <p>I shoved my way past the devils trudging off with gloomy expressions and marched right up to Vanir.</p>

  <p>“Hey, hold it right there! You got my expectations up and then pull this on me!? Isn’t that a little much!?”</p>

  <p>“Oh? I was wondering why I was tasting such delicious dark emotions. So it’s because of this pervy brat who’s head over heels for succubi. What are you doing here?”</p>

  <p>“I’m very interested in that ‘extremely shocking’ magazine. Is there really not a single copy left?”</p>

  <p>“You aren’t a devil, so why are you interested in it? Still, you’re an important customer. I do keep a spare copy on hand in case something goes wrong, but…”</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the succubi I’d been talking to earlier started making a fuss.</p>

  <p>“H-How could you!? Regular, that’s so unfair! At least let me see!”</p>

  <p>“Me too! Let me peek!”</p>

  <p>It’s not like I didn’t understand how they felt. With my expectations through the roof, I opened the magazine right there in front of the succubi…</p>

  <p>A bed of roses was depicted on the first page, and in the middle of it was Vanir’s mask.</p>

  <p>Yes. Only Vanir’s mask.</p>

  <p>“Aaah! V-V-Vanir’s nude form…”</p>

  <p>“T-This is amazing! I can’t believe even the underside of Vanir’s mask is…”</p>

  <p>Unlike the excited succubi around me, I could only stare in confusion. Vanir said cheerfully,</p>

  <p>“You really are a strange man. To desire my pinup magazine… do you perhaps hold romantic feelings toward me? Sadly, us devils have no gender, so I cannot answer your feelings… Oh, what an intense swell of dark emotions! It’s delicious indeed!”</p>
