  <p>[Originally linked by Natsume from his blog on May 2nd, 2014, this story (and several more!) was never officially published. It might be that he dropped them, or that they didn’t make the cut (or maybe he just wanted to have fun?). In any case, this takes place around volume 4, so the status quo and character relationships are a little different from the later volumes. Thanks to Striker for digging these up.]</p>

  <p>“Vampire? You mean a vampire-vampire? The high-ranking undead kind?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah. I heard he was holed up in a dungeon until a party of skilled adventurers went to take him out. Apparently he decided the whole ‘dying’ thing wasn’t for him and fled to Axel. If he burned through a lot of power fighting them, it wouldn’t be surprising if he tried to recover by sucking blood around here. You’ve got a capable priest in your party, right? If someone finds the vampire, they might ask you to handle it.”</p>

  <p>That’s what the adventurer told me.</p>

  <p>It was dusk.</p>

  <p>We didn’t have anything going on today, so everyone had scattered around town to enjoy their day off—</p>

  <p>“I see. Thanks for the heads-up. The sun’s about to set, so I’ll keep an eye out.”</p>

  <p>“No need to panic. Vampires suck blood to absorb mana, right? This town doesn’t have many people with high mana to begin with. I seriously doubt he’d bother with people like you or me.”</p>

  <p>With that, he waved and went back to his table to rejoin his companions.</p>

  <p>I’d come to the tavern for dinner, and it felt like everyone in the place was talking about the same rumor.</p>

  <p>“Hey, two garlic-toad sets over here, please~!”</p>

  <p>“And a big plate of garlic stir-fry!”</p>

  <p>Most of the orders tonight were loaded with garlic.</p>

  <p>Probably as a precaution against the vampire.</p>

  <p>Only targets people with high mana, huh…?</p>

  <p>Put another way, my party was one of the most likely targets.</p>

  <p>Aqua and Megumin both had absurd mana pools, after all.</p>

  <p>Aqua could handle just about any undead on her own, so she’d probably be fine.</p>

  <p>But Megumin… I should track her down and tell her to be careful.</p>

  <p>…Just as that thought crossed my mind, the tavern door swung open.</p>

  <p>And with it came a boisterous voice that cut cleanly through the tavern’s noise.</p>

  <p>“Zombies are nothing compared to me! You’re lucky I happened to pass by! If you want to thank me, just buy me dinner tonight!”</p>

  <p>“Y-yes! Th-thank you so much…”</p>

  <p>In walked Aqua—dragging along an unfamiliar woman with a deathly pale complexion.</p>

  <p>She held a parasol in one hand. A black cloak concealed most of her body, and she wore an impressive amount of makeup.</p>

  <p>The phrase that came to mind was “femme fatale.”</p>

  <p>Aqua spotted me and marched over, the unfamiliar woman in tow.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, you here for dinner too? Perfect timing—let’s eat together. Oh, right, introductions. This is Carmilla. I found her outside town getting mobbed by zombies and saved her from being dragged off.”</p>

  <p>“P-pleased to meet you! My name is Carmilla! I-I-I can’t thank Aqua enough for helping me…!”</p>

  <p>Carmilla stammered so hard what little color she had left drained right out of her face.</p>

  <p>…Actually.</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aqua. Apparently a vampire might’ve fled into town, so it’s probably not a great idea to wander around at night.”</p>

  <p>At that, Carmilla flinched so violently I thought she’d snap in half.</p>

  <p>“I-is that so!? H-how scary! A-a vampire, huh?”</p>

  <p>She delivered the line in the flattest, most painfully fake tone imaginable.</p>

  <p>Aqua just puffed out her chest. “It’s fine. It’s just a vampire. You saw me turn a whole horde of zombies to dust with a single Turn Undead, right? If a vampire shows up, I’ll turn him into my experience points!”</p>

  <p>“Eep!”</p>

  <p>Carmilla squeaked at Aqua’s confident declaration.</p>

  <p>No matter how you looked at it…</p>

  <p>“Still, you must be really unlucky,” I said. “Getting attacked by that many zombies while the sun’s still up. Can a vampire’s presence really change their behavior that much? Oh, right—garlic dishes are super popular tonight. Everyone’s ordering them. A young woman like you is the perfect target for a vampire, so you should eat some too, just in case.”</p>

  <p>“Eh!? N-no, I’m fine! I’m worried about my breath, so…”</p>

  <p>“Now’s not the time to worry about bad breath,” Aqua snapped. “Kazuma’s right! Eat garlic to ward off vampires! Unless there’s… some other reason you can’t eat it…?”</p>

  <p>“N-no, of course not! I’ll have some! I’ll gladly have garlic!”</p>

  <p>Aqua stared her down until Carmilla caved instantly.</p>

  <p>Between her timing and that reaction, she was obviously the vampire everyone was whispering about.</p>

  <p>Carmilla, eyes watery and expression strained like she was fighting the urge to puke, raised a spoonful of garlic-loaded food to her mouth.</p>

  <p>The adventurers around us were giving her curious looks.</p>

  <p>Apparently I wasn’t the only one who thought she looked suspiciously vampire-like.</p>

  <p>The only reason nobody said it out loud was because nobody wanted to fight a powerful undead monster inside a crowded tavern.</p>

  <p>And, of course, Aqua—completely oblivious—heaped an enormous spoonful of mashed garlic from her salad onto Carmilla’s plate.</p>

  <p>“!!!!???!!?!??”</p>

  <p>Carmilla practically levitated out of her seat at the sudden increase in garlic.</p>

  <p>“You look like you love garlic so much you’re crying, so I’ll share,” Aqua said with a bright smile. “Don’t hold back—dig in.”</p>

  <p>“T-thanff youff… vefy muff…!”</p>

  <p>As Carmilla sobbed, Aqua leaned in close and whispered low enough that only she could hear.</p>

  <p>“I’ll give you something to ward off undead. You seem weirdly attractive to zombies, so it should help. Here—hold out your hand.”</p>

  <p>“H-hmm? What is thaaaaa—!”</p>

  <p>The moment Aqua dropped something into Carmilla’s palm, it began to smoke. Carmilla immediately rolled around on the floor, shrieking in pain.</p>

  <p>“That’s an Axis Cult holy charm I poured a ton of holy mana into. It’s super effective against undead, so keep it on you. …Huh? What’s wrong? Why is your hand smoking?”</p>

  <p>“Aaaarrggh—t-this is, I-I-I’m allergic to this kind of metal! Thank you very much! I’ll treasure it!”</p>

  <p>Carmilla used chopsticks to gingerly pick up the charm, wrapped it in a handkerchief like it was radioactive, and crammed it into her pocket.</p>

  <p>Aqua grabbed Carmilla’s still-smoking hand and gently covered it with her other palm.</p>

  <p>“Sorry! I didn’t know you were allergic to metal. Don’t worry—I’m an archpriest! I’ll heal you right now! Heal!”</p>

  <p>“Aaaaaaaa… Tttttthank you, veeeeeeery muuuuuch!”</p>

  <p>Carmilla yanked her hand away the instant Aqua started casting.</p>

  <p>“Huh? It felt like your hand disappeared when I cast that healing spell…”</p>

  <p>“T-that’s your imagination! Thank you very much, I feel much better now! I already paid for your meal, so I really shouldn’t overstay my welcome…”</p>

  <p>Carmilla fired off the excuse, sprang up, and headed for the door at near-sprinting speed.</p>

  <p>Aqua smiled sweetly. “Yeah, I’m getting bored of teasing you. I guess it’s time to purify you properly.”</p>

  <p>Wait.</p>

  <p>“Y-you knew who Carmilla was the whole time!? All that was just you messing with her!?”</p>

  <p>“Of course,” Aqua said proudly. “Who do you think I am? I could tell she was undead the moment I looked at her.”</p>

  <p>This woman is a menace.</p>

  <p>“P-please spare me! I-I haven’t hurt anyone yet, so please let me go!”</p>

  <p>“No way! Undead are my enemies! So make peace with—ah, wait, Kazuma!? What are you doing!? Don’t get in my way!”</p>

  <p>I grabbed Aqua from behind and shouted at the teary-eyed, trembling Carmilla.</p>

  <p>“Run! You haven’t hurt anyone, so I’ll let you off—just hurry and get out of here!”</p>

  <p>“Th-thank you very much! I owe you for this!”</p>

  <p>“Aaaah! Traitor! Kazuma, you traitor!”</p>

  <p>Carmilla bolted from the tavern. Aqua managed to slip free after a brief wrestling match and sprinted after her.</p>

  <p>“Stop right there! You’re going to be my experience points!”</p>

  <p>“P-please let me go!”</p>

  <p>With Aqua hot on her heels, Carmilla vanished into the night.</p>

  <p>This is a world where even vampires have a hard time surviving.</p>

  <p>If there really is a goddess, please bless this harsh world…</p>
