  <p>“Well, if it isn’t Megumin. What are you doing—stalking someone? Are you really that hung up on Yunyun?”</p>

  <p>“!?”</p>

  <p>Someone suddenly called out from behind me. I jumped and spun around.</p>

  <p>“…Oh, it’s just you, Arue. Don’t startle me like that. And I’m not stalking her—I’m observing my self-proclaimed rival.”</p>

  <p>Standing behind me was my eyepatch-wearing classmate, Arue.</p>

  <p>—Today was a school holiday.</p>

  <p>I went out for a walk to kill time and found Yunyun—who also seemed to have too much free time—wandering aimlessly. So I decided to follow her.</p>

  <p>“That’s called stalking. Still, I have time to kill—mind if I join you?”</p>

  <p>And that was how Arue and I began observing the holiday of our friendless classmate.</p>

  <p>—A woman waved with a smile toward Yunyun, who’d sat down on a roadside bench to rest her legs.</p>

  <p>Yunyun blinked in surprise, then forced a stiff smile and lifted a hand to wave back…</p>

  <p>“I’m so sorry, did I keep you waiting?”</p>

  <p>“Not really, I just got here.”</p>

  <p>A man nearby waved back at the woman.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, Yunyun hurriedly turned away, her face red.</p>

  <p>The woman hadn’t been waving at Yunyun at all—she’d been waving at the man behind her.</p>

  <p>When the two sat down beside Yunyun and started chatting with each other, Yunyun muttered things like, “What’s taking them so long…? Should I go over to them instead…?”—then quickly left the area.</p>

  <p>“…Megumin, would you mind explaining what that was about?”</p>

  <p>“She wanted to get out of there, but she also didn’t want to ruin the mood between those two. It was probably a little act of consideration.”</p>

  <p>“Ow… What’s this stinging feeling in my chest?”</p>

  <p>—In the afternoon.</p>

  <p>I thought Yunyun had gone to the village diner for lunch, but instead of going in, she was pacing back and forth in front of the entrance.</p>

  <p>“What’s she doing? Megumin, translate.”</p>

  <p>“She wants to go in, but it’s crowded and the staff look busy, so she’s waiting outside to be considerate. Once some people leave and things calm down, she’ll… Ah—there she goes!”</p>

  <p>Yunyun finally entered the diner after seeing a group of customers leave.</p>

  <p>“If she’s going to wait anyway, she could’ve just gone somewhere else.”</p>

  <p>“She’s eating alone, so she wants somewhere with people around… but she’s also too considerate—and too much of a coward—to walk in when it’s packed. So she waited.”</p>

  <p>From a distance, I watched Yunyun take a seat at the corner of the diner and eat in silence.[1]</p>

  <p>While the regulars and the owner laughed loudly over idle chatter, Yunyun kept a strained smile so she wouldn’t disrupt the mood.</p>

  <p>“…I can’t look at this any longer, it hurts.”</p>

  <p>“There’s more to her misfortune than this. If you’re already tapping out, are you sure you can handle what comes next?”</p>

  <p>—After finishing her meal, Yunyun returned to her pastime of aimlessly walking around the village.</p>

  <p>“Hm? Isn’t that our classmate?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, you’re right—it’s Nerimaki. Looks like she’s practicing poses.”</p>

  <p>Nerimaki zealously practiced her signature poses in the middle of the village’s open area.</p>

  <p>She soon noticed Yunyun and started talking to her about something.</p>

  <p>“…Looks like she wants Yunyun to help her practice.”</p>

  <p>Receiving some sort of instruction from Nerimaki, Yunyun then struck a pose.</p>

  <p>After a brief moment of consideration, Nerimaki gave a few more instructions.</p>

  <p>It seemed like she was developing a new signature pose.</p>

  <p>Once she settled on a pose she liked, she began practicing it herself.</p>

  <p>“So she won’t refuse a request even if she doesn’t want to, huh?”</p>

  <p>“She’s the type who’ll get used by men with bad intentions. If someone got on their knees and begged, she’d probably even go on a date with some suspicious old man… Oh—looks like she’s leaving.”</p>

  <p>Yunyun, whose face was still red in embarrassment, said her goodbyes and went elsewhere.</p>

  <p>—Then, after walking around leisurely and defenselessly all day, she suddenly became wary of her surroundings.</p>

  <p>For a moment, I thought we had been busted, but it seems like it wasn’t the case.</p>

  <p>After confirming there was no one around, she squatted down by a bush.</p>

  <p>Then she scattered what looked like leftovers from lunch—bits of fried fish—on the ground.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the bush shook and out came a cat.</p>

  <p>“…Is she feeding it? That’s sweet of her.”</p>

  <p>“No, wait. Look—she’s saying something to it.”</p>

  <p>Hiding in a nearby bush, we quieted down and listened intently to what Yunyun was saying.</p>

  <p>“…She just asked the cat, ’Can we be friends?‘ Megumin, I can’t just stand here and watch anymore. Can’t we jump out right now and hang out with her?”</p>

  <p>“W-wait! If we show up now, she’ll realize we heard everything! I’m pretty sure she’d die of embarrassment. Let’s pretend we didn’t see anything and leave for a… Ah!”</p>

  <p>The cat quickly gobbled down the fish and slipped back into the bush.</p>

  <p>Honestly, just watching her from behind made me want to cry.</p>

  <p>“Megumin… Megumin…-!”</p>

  <p>“I get it, I get it! Stop shaking my shoulders. Let’s leave for now and loop back around. Then we can pretend we just ran into her and hang out for a bit, okay…?”</p>

  <p>Just as I was about to say ’let’s go’-</p>

  <p>“Oh? Hey, it’s Yunyun.”</p>

  <p>“It really is. What are you doing here?”</p>

  <p>“Ah—Funifura, Dodonko, g-good afternoon! There’s a cat in the bush over there, you see… Um, anyway, what are you two doing here?”</p>

  <p>Having had the question turned on them, the two exchanged glances for a brief moment.</p>

  <p>“Well, as you can see, Dodonko and I were thinking about playing some badminton.”</p>

  <p>“Mm-hm, that’s right. Oh—if you’re free, Yunyun, why don’t you join us?”</p>

  <p>Yunyun’s face lit up at the invitation, but then her gaze dropped to the two rackets…</p>

  <p>“I-, I’m sorry, I have something to do…”</p>

  <p>Saying that, she trudged away with her head down.</p>

  <p>“Hey, explain what Yunyun just did!”</p>

  <p>“She’s thrilled to be invited, but then she realized there aren’t enough rackets if she joins in. Even though she’s free, she decided to be considerate, and so…”</p>

  <p>Before I could finish my explanation, Arue jumped out of the bush we were hiding in.</p>

  <p>Of course, I followed after her.</p>

  <p>“Hey, you three! Want to play a five-person game with us!?”</p>
