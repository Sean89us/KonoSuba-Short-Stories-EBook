  <h1>Megumin the Ripper</h1>

  <p>Volume 2 special short story</p>

  <p>Translator: Cannongerbil</p>

  <p>Editors: Ulti</p>

  <p>Occurrence: After Volume 2</p>

  <p>[TL Note: This story is a parody of “Jack the Ripper,” the unidentified serial killer from 19th-century London who was infamous for “ripping” open his victims’ abdomens.]</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>“Today, I’d like to show everyone the famous sword of ’Shack the Ripper.‘ I’d like any magicians here to help identify what kind of weapon this is.”</p>

  <p>As the guild employee said that, she placed a blade on the table.</p>

  <p>—Megumin invited me to the guild, but honestly, I was only here because I had time to kill.</p>

  <p>“…Hey, Megumin. What’s a ’Shack the Ripper’?”</p>

  <p>If I remember correctly, there was a mass murderer with a similar name back on earth.</p>

  <p>“Shack was an extraordinary swordsman with ridiculous skill. For some reason, he never left a scratch on his opponents’ bodies. Basically, he was a depraved pervert who only ever ’ripped’ their clothes.”</p>

  <p>What? Isn’t that incredible? He could shred someone’s clothes without leaving a mark on their skin. That’s not swordsmanship—that’s mastery of the art of stripping.</p>

  <p>“That sword is definitely the one Shack used. The other day, his hideout was discovered in this town, and this was recovered from it…”</p>

  <p>The employee kept the explanation vague.</p>

  <p>“Our appraisers determined that it’s a cursed blade, enchanted with powerful magic… But when we handed it to someone with the Swordsman class to test it, they reported it was too dull to even beat a kobold…”</p>

  <p>An extraordinary pervert’s… No, an extraordinary swordsman’s favorite sword, huh.</p>

  <p>“Could it be one of those things? Like how legendary swords choose their owners…?”</p>

  <p>Though I had said this without thinking, the entire guild, for one reason or another, fell into a state of commotion.</p>

  <p>Finally, an adventurer picked up the sword and, without thinking much of it, examined the edge.</p>

  <p>—Then, the guild doors were flung open.</p>

  <p>“Hah… Excuse me! I’ve completed the request, ’Capture the neroid that escaped from the tavern,’ no problem! I’d like an employee to confirm the neroids!”</p>

  <p>A female warrior energetically cried out through the guild.</p>

  <p>At her feet was a cage full of mysterious creatures that were hard to describe.</p>

  <p>—I don’t know what the adventurer with Shack’s sword was thinking, but he suddenly swung it at the neroid!</p>

  <p>“Ah—!?”</p>

  <p>“Mya-”</p>

  <p>The neroid let out a frightened cry, but there wasn’t a single wound on it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, the adventurer fell to one knee as if the strength had drained out of him.</p>

  <p>“Damn… I wasn’t recognized by the sword…”</p>

  <p>“Y-you! What are you doing all of a sudden!? I finally managed to catch it—what are you trying to do!?”</p>

  <p>The female warrior lashed out at the man.</p>

  <p>“Ah-!?”</p>

  <p>She shrieked…</p>

  <p>“Nyan~”</p>

  <p>“…Damnit! I’m not it either huh….!”</p>

  <p>“What is this!? Hey, what is happening!? Do you guys really hate me… Wha-, Stop!”</p>

  <p>As the female warrior continued to cry out, everyone else took turns with Shack’s sword to slash the innocent neroid.</p>

  <p>In the end, the neroid in the cage didn’t have a single cut on it, and the sword was returned to the table.</p>

  <p>…I tried once too, but it didn’t work for me either.</p>

  <p>“Hmm… I wonder. Maybe this sword can’t be used by anyone except a pervert? If that’s the case, then…”</p>

  <p>“…Hey. You’re looking at me, aren’t you? Care to explain?”</p>

  <p>“I-It’s nothing. It’s nothing, okay?”</p>

  <p>Then Megumin—like she was trying to cheat—reached for the sword and…</p>

  <p>—cut the table it was resting on clean in half.</p>

  <p>“?!?!”</p>

  <p>Realizing Megumin had somehow split the table in two, everyone in the guild froze in shock.</p>

  <p>“…Could it be… that Megumin is the one the sword chose…?”</p>

  <p>In response to the employee’s mutter, everyone gulped audibly.</p>

  <p>—Then, Megumin wordlessly approached the neroid; sword in hand.</p>

  <p>“!? W-, What are you trying to do! Just stop this already, otherwise I won’t be able to fulfill the request! I mean, why is everybody slashing the neroid that I captured! What did I do wrong!?”</p>

  <p>As Megumin brandished the sword and slashed the neroid, the female warrior became silent.</p>

  <p>“-…!? …Huh!? Nothing—…Ahhhhh-!”</p>

  <p>The female warrior who had instinctively closed her eyes, reopened her eyes, and saw that the lock of the neroid’s cage had been cut apart.</p>

  <p>“I have cut a worthless object…”</p>

  <p>[TL Note: This is Goemon Ishikawa’s catchphrase from Lupin the 3rd. He typically says it after an amazing feat of swordsmanship.]</p>

  <p>“Waaait! After all the trouble I went through to catch it, why—!?”</p>

  <p>As Megumin was drowned in her own satisfaction, the female warrior frantically chased after the escaped neroid.</p>

  <p>“”“WOAHHHHH!”“”</p>

  <p>The people in the guild burst into cheers and started shoving random things at Megumin.</p>

  <p>“Hey, hey, can that sword really cut anything!? Can you cut this for me!?”</p>

  <p>“M-me too! I can’t get this lid open!”</p>

  <p>No matter what they handed her, she cut it apart with ease.</p>

  <p>It was the real deal. That sword really was cursed.</p>

  <p>I borrowed the sword from Megumin and tried again.</p>

  <p>Maybe it was the “chosen” thing, but all I managed was a scratch on a piece of metal.</p>

  <p>The excited guild employee ran towards Megumin and clasped her hands.</p>

  <p>“Megumin! Please excuse my behavior, but I have a special request for you. We’d like you to test what that sword can cut—and find the limits of its power. As for the reward… would this do?”</p>

  <p>The amount of the employee suggested was definitely not a small amount.</p>

  <p>“Hmph… Very well. I suppose.”</p>

  <p>Megumin attached the sword to her belt, and gave an exaggerated nod.</p>

  <p>I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was a slight misunderstanding here.</p>

  <p>“Master, help with this too! I can’t bring myself to destroy this letter from my ex-girlfriend!”</p>

  <p>“Master! My little brother got trapped in this wooden crate and I can’t open it! Please help!”</p>

  <p>“Master! This is about my boss’s secret stash, but I can’t open his safe! Could I ask you to open it!?”</p>

  <p>Once word got out that the guild would “cut anything” as a service, townspeople flooded in one after another with requests.</p>

  <p>…More importantly, weren’t some of those things they could cut without a cursed sword? And weren’t some of those things we really <em>shouldn’t</em> be cutting up?</p>

  <p>While I was busy playing the straight man in my head, Megumin had already moved on to the next item.</p>

  <p>And then she cut, and cut, and cut some more.</p>

  <p>Finally, by sunset, the crowd thinned out.</p>

  <p>Bathed in the orange light of the setting sun, Megumin—</p>

  <p>“Kazuma… ’The peak of mastery’ is such a vain thing, isn’t it…?”</p>

  <p>“Y-you… You just got the sword and had a sudden power-up. Why are you acting like a master swordsman?”</p>

  <p>Despite my deadpan response, Megumin kept up the act.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma… for the last thing, I want you to come with me to face my nemesis.”</p>

  <p>Megumin showed a serious expression.</p>

  <p>“My great self once fought a hard battle against the giant toads… With explosion magic, I couldn’t defeat two of them… However, the current me is different! …Yes—this is the time to show the fruits of my training! It is time for our ultimate showdown!”</p>

  <p>“You say ’showdown,‘ but didn’t you just get gobbled up last time?”</p>

  <p>On the plains a short distance from town, still glowing in the sunset, Megumin faced off with a giant toad.</p>

  <p>After the townspeople started calling her “Master,” she’d been acting even weirder than usual.</p>

  <p>The giant toad, as if ignoring Megumin, didn’t even budge.</p>

  <p>…Well, with “current Megumin,” she probably wouldn’t get swallowed like she did before.</p>

  <p>As I optimistically observed the scene…</p>

  <p>“Ahh, there you are! Kazuma, Megumin! We found it!”</p>

  <p>I turned towards the guild employee with a puzzled expression…</p>

  <p>“Actually, about that cursed sword… After searching Shack’s hideout, we figured out its secret. It uses magic power to cut objects, so someone with a lot of mana can use it easily… Also, the blade can’t cut living creatures, which is probably how Shack managed to rip people’s clothes… So if you try to use it against monsters…”</p>

  <p>Then, the employee abruptly stopped.</p>

  <p>—She too, witnessed Megumin being swallowed by the giant toad.</p>
