  <p>“I’m thinking of doing some missionary work.”</p>

  <p>“…” x4</p>

  <p>Aqua suddenly said that, and everyone present fell into stunned silence, unsure as to how to react.</p>

  <p>And then…</p>

  <p>“How long are you staying in town, Chris? You’re welcome to room with us as long as you need.”</p>

  <p>“…Yeah, we left the room you were staying in just as it was. We can drink together late into the night again.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, thanks. Actually, it’s gotten a lot warmer out, so I was planning on renting a place in the stables.”</p>

  <p>“We have a room free, so it’d be a waste not to use it. Want to have dinner together?”</p>

  <p>[In the WN, Chris briefly stayed with the party during the winter.]</p>

  <p>Everyone greeted Chris who came to visit us warmly.</p>

  <p>“Hey, listen to me! I’m talking about something very important here! Here—everyone who doesn’t have a religion, fill this out!”</p>

  <p>Saying that, Aqua placed a stack of papers on the table.</p>

  <p>Those were all Axis Cult recruitment forms.</p>

  <p>I snatched one, crumpled it into a ball, and took aim at the trash bin…</p>

  <p>“Snipe!”</p>

  <p>“Aaah!”</p>

  <p>Snipe doesn’t work on thrown objects, but I yelled it for the vibes anyway, and the crumpled ball flew beautifully into the bin.</p>

  <p>“What are you doing, you shitty NEET!? You’ll get divine punishment!”</p>

  <p>Aqua ran over to the bin and retrieved the crumpled up recruitment form.</p>

  <p>“What made you start talking about missionary work in the first place? You don’t normally act like a priest, so what came over you?”</p>

  <p>“Aah! You too, Megumin!?”</p>

  <p>Megumin folded one of the recruitment forms into a paper airplane and sent it flying.</p>

  <p>As Aqua chased after it, Darkness folded her arms and muttered,</p>

  <p>“Mmm… I’m a Crusader who offered my sword to Lady Eris, so…”</p>

  <p>“What? Even though you’re just a fake Crusader! Fine, I’ll go get recruits by myself!”</p>

  <p>“P-Phony Crusader!?”</p>

  <p>As Aqua prepared to storm off in a huff, Chris grabbed the stack of recruitment forms and stood up.</p>

  <p>“Aqua, don’t forget these! And… I’m worried about you, so let me tag along, too.”</p>

  <p>At those words, Aqua whipped around with a surprised look on her face.</p>

  <p>“…C-Chris…! W-Waaaaah! I can’t believe you are my only ally in this house! Waaaaah!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Chris, don’t spoil that idiot too much. She’ll definitely let it go to her head and run off to do something stupid again.”</p>

  <p>Chris, taken aback, stroked Aqua’s hair as she tearfully clung to her.</p>

  <p>Seeing the two of them, Megumin whispered to me.</p>

  <p>“Sorry, I’m a little worried about her, so can you stick with her too? I’ll have dinner ready for everyone when you get back, so…”</p>

  <p>“…Phony Crusader…”</p>

  <p>Next to her, Darkness sat gloomily on the sofa, seemingly shaken to her very core by those words.</p>

  <p>Oh, fine…</p>

  <p>[In the WN, hints were dropped as to Chris’s true identity, but that’s one plotline that was dropped in the LN, so Kazuma never finds out that Chris is Eris in the WN.]</p>

  <p>“Chris, as my only ally, it’s best that I reveal my true identity to you right now.”</p>

  <p>I don’t know where she’s headed, but Aqua said that while making her way down the street with the stack of recruitment forms in her hand.</p>

  <p>Chris, holding a similar stack of papers in her hand, nodded along as she followed behind her,</p>

  <p>“Indeed, my true identity is the warmhearted and beautiful Goddess of Water! Aqua in the flesh! The other day, the greengrocer said, ’You took her name and even dress like her—must be devotion,‘ but that’s not it at all! I’m the real deal! I’m a real goddess!”</p>

  <p>Aqua suddenly spun around and delivered that speech to Chris.</p>

  <p>So that’s what happened. That was probably the whole reason she suddenly brought up gaining more followers.</p>

  <p>Still, even if you say that, I don’t think there’d be anyone in this world who’d believe you…</p>

  <p>“Is that so? That’s amazing! Thank you for telling me.”</p>

  <p>Chris said with a smile on her face…</p>

  <p>…Eh?</p>

  <p>“Eh!? You believed her that easily!?”</p>

  <p>“Y-Yeah! Aren’t you going to laugh, or say taking a god’s name so casually will bring divine punishment, or start throwing stones at me or anything? You believed me that easily?”</p>

  <p>Not only me, but Aqua seemed equally surprised.</p>

  <p>Still, I can’t believe she pulled that without me knowing.</p>

  <p>“Back when that dullahan killed a bunch of people in town, you were the one who brought them all back, right? I knew even then you weren’t just an ordinary person.”</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! I knew it, you are my only true ally! Chris, won’t you join the Axis Cult!? If you join now, I’ll show you the legendary act of having boiling tea pour out of your navel!”</p>

  <p>“N-No, I’m an Eris… Ah! Aqua, don’t cry! Come on, let’s work hard to gather more followers!”</p>

  <p>…I have a really bad feeling about this.</p>

  <p>“Right, then, let’s get going!”</p>

  <p>As Aqua took the lead once more, I followed behind Chris and whispered to her,</p>

  <p>“Hey, Chris, I can already see her messing up and ending up in tears, so why don’t we just go grab some tea and hurry back home?”</p>

  <p>“Y-You don’t really have much respect for gods, do you… Aqua is a really powerful and important goddess, you know? No one can live without water. Everyone takes getting fresh water every day for granted, so no one respects her the way they should.”</p>

  <p>Chris said that in reply.</p>

  <p>Still…</p>

  <p>“Hey, Chris! It might not be particularly useful to you, but I’m going to teach you some great ways to win people’s faith and grow your followers!”</p>

  <p>“Ah, thanks…”</p>

  <p>Aqua walked along with a spring in her step, probably overjoyed that Chris had acknowledged her.</p>

  <p>Seeing her like this makes it hard to think of her as a powerful water goddess…</p>

  <p>“Ah, over there! There are probably a lot of people in trouble over there!”</p>

  <p>That was a small store tucked away in a back alley.</p>

  <p>Just as I was wondering what kind of store it was, a blond, thuggish-looking adventurer with a hard stare came out holding a few wads of eris bills.</p>

  <p>…Actually, I know that guy.</p>

  <p>Looking closer, it was a moneylender.</p>

  <p>I never knew a place like that existed in Axel.</p>

  <p>…How did Aqua know about this store?</p>

  <p>Aqua boldly walked up to the store and sat down in front of it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that, the owner—a rugged-looking, middle-aged man—came rushing out.</p>

  <p>This isn’t good, I should get Aqua out of here before it becomes a fight…!</p>

  <p>“…Hey, come on, Aqua. I’ve told you plenty of times I can’t lend you money, haven’t I? We can’t lend to people who have no ability to pay. And I don’t want any trouble with the Axis Cult, so lending to Axis cultists is strictly off-limits.”</p>

  <p>So they know each other.</p>

  <p>“Hey, why are you so mean to Axis cultists? When those kids are in trouble, I’d really like it if you could lend them money without discrimination! …Anyway, I’m not here to borrow money or harass you. I’m not short on money right now.”</p>

  <p>“…Just by sitting there, you’re already harassing us plenty… So why are you here today?”</p>

  <p>“I thought I’d give advice to people who are desperate enough to come here—tell them not to borrow from places like this.”</p>

  <p>“So you are here to harass us! Stop getting in the way of our business! Seriously, give me a break. This is why Axis cultists are so troublesome. Here—take this bottle of wine as a donation, and please leave.”</p>

  <p>As Chris and I watched from a distance, Aqua returned to us with a bottle of wine in her hand.</p>

  <p>“See?”</p>

  <p>“Don’t give me that! What did you even come out here for! Stop giving people trouble and start doing some missionary work already!”</p>

  <p>“Aqua, that wasn’t missionary work—that was just plain blackmail! You really shouldn’t do that kind of stuff! The Axis Cult’s reputation will sink even further!”</p>

  <p>—After leaving the shop, we had a strategy meeting on a street corner.</p>

  <p>“Fine. I’ll just have to think of a couple good ways to recruit people for you.”</p>

  <p>“With the underhanded, sly, and surprisingly silver-tongued Kazuma on my side, this is as good as done!”</p>

  <p>“You’re kind of reckless with your plans, so I’m a little uneasy… Ah, don’t bully Aqua, you’ll get divine punishment!”</p>

  <p>As I pulled on Aqua’s cheeks in revenge for her praise-that-sounded-like-an-insult, Chris hurriedly rushed over to stop me.</p>

  <p>She really shouldn’t coddle her that much…</p>

  <p>“Right, here’s the plan. Approaching people who are in trouble isn’t a bad idea—the problem is you picked the wrong place. Anyone who goes there is desperate for money, so you’d basically have to pay them to listen. You don’t want to buy followers with cash, right?”</p>

  <p>“I don’t mind at all.”</p>

  <p>“Aqua! You can’t do that! Faith is a very precious thing!”</p>

  <p>Chris immediately started lecturing Aqua after hearing her say that with a straight face.</p>

  <p>…I always thought of her as a rambunctious, happy-go-lucky tomboy, but she seems to be quite pious despite being a thief.</p>

  <p>“Well, anyway, first we need someone in need. Aqua, go take the toilet paper from all the toilets in the park. Then we’ll set up a stakeout nearby.”</p>

  <p>“I see, you’re targeting people who rush to the bathroom in their time of need! As expected of Kazuma, you really are reliable in times like these!”</p>

  <p>“You two have it completely backwards! What is the point of getting people into trouble!? This is why the Axis Cult gets such a bad rap!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, Chris, is this really going to work? Wouldn’t it be better for me to put on an act, then get people to sign the paper if they want to see the rest?”</p>

  <p>On the busiest street in Axel, Aqua nervously said to Chris while holding a stack of papers.</p>

  <p>Chris’s plan was to honestly preach their doctrine to passersby and gain new recruits that way.</p>

  <p>“You can’t do that, Aqua. That wouldn’t solve anything at all… Why are you soliciting in the first place? To bring salvation to those in need, right? …Even if no one listens, there’s no need to feel down. If someone is guided by your voice and joins the faith, that means you’ve saved someone in trouble. If our voice doesn’t reach anyone, that simply means no one is in trouble. If no one joins, that means not a single person you met today is suffering. In other words, it’s a wonderful day.”</p>

  <p>Chris said with a gentle smile.</p>

  <p>“…What’s with you, Chris? You sound like a priest with lines like that.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah. It’s kind of weird for me to say this, but I think Chris might be more suited to being a priest than even me.”</p>

  <p>“!? Ah, no, that’s not it! You know, I think Darkness said something like that a while back! I’m just passing it on!”</p>

  <p>The fake Crusader actually said something that cool?</p>

  <p>Aqua grabbed her stack of papers with a look of fresh determination.</p>

  <p>“Well, never mind. Yeah, there’s no point doubting myself before I even start! I’m going to convert all the Eris cultists in this world into Axis cultists and make the Axis Cult the dominant religion!”</p>

  <p>“I-I really wish you wouldn’t do that…”</p>

  <p>Chris muttered under her breath as she saw Aqua charge off.</p>

  <p>—A few minutes later.</p>

  <p>“Axis Cult! Axis Cult! Please join the Axis Cult! Is anyone in trouble!? Is anyone at a loss!? Please think of the Axis Cult when you’re in trouble! Please think of the Axis Cult when you’re unhappy! …Young man, you look troubled—would you be interested in having a word?”</p>

  <p>Aqua occasionally said unnecessary things and got pelted with rocks, but she seemed completely undeterred as she threw them back and raised her voice again.</p>

  <p>“Please consider the Axis Cult!”</p>

  <p>—One hour later.</p>

  <p>“Umm, how about joining the Axis Cult? Umm, something good will befall you. Aren’t you interested at all? You’ll become better at your craft, and, umm, you’ll definitely hear a lot of happy voices in your future, you know?”</p>

  <p>Aqua’s sales pitch was starting to go in strange directions as people continued passing her by without paying her any heed.</p>

  <p>Chris watched with clenched fists.</p>

  <p>“Umm… I’ll teach you a wonderful act that will definitely liven any room up…”</p>

  <p>Don’t lose focus!</p>

  <p>Keep at it! Keep at it for just a while more.</p>

  <p>—Three hours later.</p>

  <p>“…Axis Cult… Sniff… Axis Cult… Is anyone… Sniff… interested?”</p>

  <p>Looks like this was her limit.</p>

  <p>I got up to collect Aqua, who was sniffling through her sales pitch…</p>

  <p>—But Chris grabbed the hem of my shirt.</p>

  <p>Then, Chris walked straight over to her.</p>

  <p>“Sniff… Axis Cult… Axis Cult… Ah…”</p>

  <p>When she noticed Chris’s presence, Aqua’s face twisted like she was about to finally break into tears.</p>

  <p>Chris placed a comforting hand on her shoulders and said in a firm voice,</p>

  <p>“Aqua, good work. Your efforts today aren’t in vain. After all, it simply means that none of the people you’ve met today are troubled. If you think of it as evidence of yet another peaceful day, doesn’t it feel like a good thing that you couldn’t recruit a single person today?”</p>

  <p>“…Not at all…”</p>

  <p>It didn’t seem like Chris’s words got through to Aqua as she buried her face in Chris’s chest and cried.</p>

  <p>“…Hey, there’s always tomorrow! Let’s work hard again tomorrow, okay? I’ll help you every day. Tomorrow, let’s lend a hand to the people in town who really need it!”</p>

  <p>At Chris’s encouragement, Aqua tearfully nodded.</p>

  <p>…Well, she’ll probably perk up after going home and eating the food Megumin has prepared.</p>

  <p>—Just then.</p>

  <p>“As expected, an Eris Church member really is different! Well said!”</p>

  <p>“It really is! It’s even making me want to give it my all tomorrow!”</p>

  <p>“The Eris Church really is different. You look really cool.”</p>

  <p>“This is why the Eris Church is so reliable! You know, I’ve heard devout Eris worshippers can get loans without any security or interest!”</p>

  <p>“I’m joining the Eris Church!”</p>

  <p>The people who happened to be passing by suddenly exploded into praises for Chris.</p>

  <p>They probably figured out she was a member of the Eris Church from the shining pendant she was wearing.</p>

  <p>“Eh!? No, eh, t-that’s…! I… I… That’s not what I’m trying to do…!”</p>

  <p>As Chris was thrown into confusion by the sudden outpouring of praise, Aqua shakily got to her feet.</p>

  <p>“T-The Eris Church is my enemy~! Waaaaaah! What’s so great about that padded goddess!?”</p>

  <p>“A-Aqua!? Don’t shout that at the top of your lungs while running through the street!”</p>

  <p>As Aqua shot off in tears, Chris hastily chased after her.</p>

  <p>Of course, Aqua being Aqua, she was in a good mood again by the time dinner was served.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, it seems like the Eris Church gained a few more followers that day.</p>
