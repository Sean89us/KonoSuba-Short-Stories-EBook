  <p>“…Special Request?”</p>

  <p>That day, we paid a visit to the adventurers’ guild, and that was what the receptionist told us.</p>

  <p>“Yes. We’d like Kazuma’s party—or rather, Aqua specifically—to take on a special job.”</p>

  <p>Normally, adventurers took jobs by browsing the noticeboard and taking any quests that struck their fancy.</p>

  <p>However, if you’re skilled or famous enough, it’s possible that someone might request you for a job by name.</p>

  <p>They usually pay better, and getting one is a mark of fame for most adventurers, so they’re almost always welcome.</p>

  <p>“Why would they ask for Aqua by name? The client’s probably up to something.”</p>

  <p>“Or it might be someone who just moved to town. Aqua’s an Archpriest, after all. If you don’t know anything else about her, she sounds like a really powerful adventurer.”</p>

  <p>“You two, if you keep saying stuff like that, I’ll punish you with divine retribution—you’re fated to run into Kazuma in the bath.”</p>

  <p>Darkness and Megumin were just teasing Aqua, but they didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.</p>

  <p>I’ll ask about that punishment later. Right now, I was curious about the request.</p>

  <p>The receptionist nodded along without raising any objections.</p>

  <p>“Yes, about that—we confirmed it with the client multiple times. Are you sure you’ve got the right person, is that really okay, you’re fine with waiving compensation if the request fails, and so on… But it seems like he’s fully aware of what he’s doing if he’s asking for Aqua…”</p>

  <p>“Miss Receptionist, if you keep saying things like that, I’ll punish you so the hot water stops flowing right after you’ve shampooed your hair, just when you’re about to rinse it out.”</p>

  <p>Even though she had no reason to know what Aqua really was, the receptionist still seemed taken aback and hurriedly waved her hands.</p>

  <p>“But I understand why he did so after hearing him out. The request is—”</p>

  <p>—The next day.</p>

  <p>“Please leave the offerings over here. And line the wine up from cheapest to most expensive.”</p>

  <p>In the fields outside town, a crowd of adventurers were making preparations for the rain-calling ritual under Aqua’s supervision.</p>

  <p>The request turned out to be for Aqua to call down rain across the region. Water-related magic is the one thing she’s actually good at, so I guess it wasn’t too surprising.</p>

  <p>“…Hey, will this really make it rain? Couldn’t we just have Aqua use Sacred Create Water instead?”</p>

  <p>It hadn’t rained in a while, and the fields around town were starting to run short on water.</p>

  <p>However, magic exists in this world.</p>

  <p>You’d think they could just bring in a few mages and solve the problem with a few rounds of Create Water.</p>

  <p>“Kazuma, magic doesn’t create water out of nothing, you know? Create Water and similar spells just pull water from the surrounding area. If you water the fields with it, you’re just taking moisture out of the air, so it won’t solve anything long-term.”</p>

  <p>… Yeah, if you can create an infinite amount of water from nothing, the amount of water in the world would steadily increase until it eventually turns the entire planet into a ball of water.</p>

  <p>This world is under the guidance of a goddess, after all. I’m sure they put limits in place so it can’t be destroyed so easily.</p>

  <p>“I see… Wait, then what about Create Earth? Is it pulling dirt up from deep underground, too?”</p>

  <p>“How would I know anything about earth? It probably comes from some mysterious space or something.”</p>

  <p>What the hell is this mysterious space? I regret feeling admiration for her for even a moment.</p>

  <p>“Aqua, I can just leave the offerings here, right? There’s a lot of alcohol mixed in with them. This isn’t for your personal use, is it? You’re not messing around with the ritual, are you?”</p>

  <p>“What are you saying, Megumin? All creatures associated with water love wine. This is a sacred ritual to gather the local water spirits. I’m borrowing a little of their power in exchange for all this wine.”</p>

  <p>Aqua explained with a rare serious expression on her face. Just then, Darkness showed up carrying a large, expensive-looking bottle.</p>

  <p>“Should I start scattering this wine around? I heard they especially love wine as an offering, so I brought the most expensive bottle my father has in his collection.”</p>

  <p>“What are you saying, Darkness? It’d be a waste to scatter something that expensive around. Leave that bottle over there. It’s part of the ritual. Yes, a very important part of the ritual.”</p>

  <p>She’s definitely planning on keeping the expensive wine for herself.</p>

  <p>Just then, the adventurers who were busy with the preparations called out to Aqua.</p>

  <p>“Aqua, we’ve finished arranging the offerings!”</p>

  <p>“Is there anything else we need to do?”</p>

  <p>The wine bottles had been lined up neatly, and the people who came to witness this rare ceremony had formed a big crowd, chattering in anticipation.</p>

  <p>“Oh, now this is a nice sight. Very well, I’ll begin the ritual. I need to show everyone what a goddess can really do every so often.”</p>

  <p>In front of the rows of bottles, Aqua happily looked up into the sky—</p>

  <p>“Oh, my kin who live in this world… the Goddess of water, Aqua, calls you…”</p>

  <p>Just like back during the battle with Beldia, Aqua gave off a very solemn aura—</p>

  <p>“… A-Ah! Wait a minute! I haven’t told you to do anything yet, so don’t start gathering on your own!”</p>

  <p>Something unexpected must have happened, because Aqua suddenly shouted in a panic.</p>

  <p>I could feel the humidity spike.</p>

  <p>She’s probably seeing something that we can’t see, but…</p>

  <p>“You got that? I’m ordering you as a goddess: don’t make it rain yet. Eventually I’m going to say, ’It seems like we need more offerings…‘ and gesture for them to bring more wine. Then you can make it rain… Understand?”</p>

  <p>Aqua shouted to empty air, but everyone understood that they didn’t actually need any offerings.</p>

  <p>Just as the adventurers started discreetly snagging bottles of wine for themselves, Aqua cleared her throat.</p>

  <p>“In the name of the goddess Aqua… Hey, I told you not yet!… Huh? You want an offering? Okay, fine, I’ll give you some wine later… Ah, not that one! Pick a cheaper bottle!”</p>

  <p>Even though she hadn’t even asked for rain yet, thick storm clouds had already gathered over the fields.</p>

  <p>“Why are the water spirits in this world so temperamental!? Ah! Wait! I had my eye on that one!”</p>

  <p>Apparently, the local water spirits had personalities a lot like someone we knew.</p>

  <p>“Waaaaah! My wine!”</p>

  <p>In the end, we fled from the sudden downpour that descended over the fields and praised Aqua for managing to be useful for once—</p>

  <p>A few days later.</p>

  <p>The Axis Cult gained a new follower after Aqua gave him a little rain charm she made while she was bored—a “teruteru Aqua” that could call down rain when turned upside down—but that’s a story for another time.</p>
