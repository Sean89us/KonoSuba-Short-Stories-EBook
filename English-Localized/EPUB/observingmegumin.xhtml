  <hr/>

  <p>While I was at the adventurers’ guild, looking for easy, profitable quests like I always do, I got a strange, “off the record” request from Kazuma. It seems the guild views him as the caretaker of his party, so they keep making him clean up after their messes.</p>

  <p>He wanted me to investigate what his party gets up to when he’s not around.</p>

  <p>He’s a close friend I owe a lot to, and he even promised a decent reward, so I had no reason to refuse.</p>

  <p>In that case… today, I’ll observe that explosion maniac.</p>

  <p>She’s a Crimson Demon like Yunyun. According to Vanir, the Crimson Demons are a belligerent clan whose members are born with huge mana reserves.</p>

  <p>You can tell they have a unique sense of aesthetics just from their naming alone. And in that sense, Megumin is considered a prodigy.</p>

  <p>The reason: aside from Explosion, she has no intention of learning any other spell.</p>

  <p>Normally, she drags Kazuma outside the town to cast Explosion every day, but after he started refusing because of the cold, she began making the trip with other people.</p>

  <p>…You can only call yourself a true resident of Axel after you get used to hearing an explosion every day.</p>

  <p>“Did I make you wait?”</p>

  <p>“I think it’s about time you stopped doing this.”</p>

  <p>Today’s companion is Yunyun.</p>

  <p>“That’ll never happen. Don’t you know I’ll die if I don’t cast an explosion every day?”</p>

  <p>“I’ve never heard of such a thing! …Still, whenever I carry you back lately, the townspeople look at me kindly. Someone even told me, ’Thanks for your hard work,‘ the other day. It made me a little happy…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun might grumble, but even through her frown, she looked genuinely happy to be relied on.</p>

  <p>“Stop complaining. Let’s go.”</p>

  <p>“Wha—why are you ordering me around? I’m the one accompanying you! Hey, did you hear me? W-Wait up!”</p>

  <p>Despite her protests, Yunyun still ended up following Megumin out of town.</p>

  <p>At this point, it was less that she was accompanying her and more that she couldn’t refuse.</p>

  <p>It always feels like if you knelt and begged, she’d agree to just about anything.</p>

  <p>Trailing behind them, I followed the two to a stretch of barren land.</p>

  <p>…More accurately, it only became barren because of that explosion girl.</p>

  <p>I think this used to be a small forest. Now the soil was exposed, and the area was dotted with craters.</p>

  <p>“This place is full of holes! You need to fill them in properly later, or you’ll cause people a lot of trouble.”</p>

  <p>“I’ll leave that to you. I’m a very busy person.”</p>

  <p>While Yunyun hurried to fill the craters in with magic, Megumin casually fired off her Explosion and carved a brand-new crater into the landscape.</p>

  <p>Yunyun hoisted the collapsed Megumin onto her back with practiced ease and complained the whole way back.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached town, Megumin had recovered enough to walk on her own and climbed down from Yunyun’s back.</p>

  <p>“I’ve fulfilled your request, so—just like we agreed—let’s settle our duel right here!”</p>

  <p>“Even after losing so many times… You really don’t learn, do you? So what are we competing in today?”</p>

  <p>“Ah, um… We should settle this with magic… but Megumin only knows Explosion, and she already used it today, so that won’t work.”</p>

  <p>“I’ve already used my magic for today. I don’t mean to brag, but I’m useless for the rest of the day.”</p>

  <p>“That’s not something to brag about!”</p>

  <p>“Aah! What did you say? Say that again!”</p>

  <p>“D-Don’t get angry.”</p>

  <p>“You’ve always been bad at reading the room, Yunyun, but hasn’t it gotten worse lately? It must be the bad influence of that friend you recently made.”</p>

  <p>Yunyun clutched Megumin’s clothes and tearfully denied it. Who was this friend they were talking about?</p>

  <p>Megumin is Yunyun’s childhood friend, so I could rule her out. Other than that, the only people Yunyun had been interacting with lately were Vanir and that beautiful shop owner.</p>

  <p>Did she make a new friend without me knowing? Seeing how desperately she denied it, it must be a pretty nasty character.</p>

  <p>In the end, they settled on an eating contest, and Megumin won by a landslide.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to believe she can eat that much with such a petite frame. Still, she doesn’t seem to have grown at all.</p>

  <p>Afterward, she chatted with the Axis Cult priest and Chris about something or other, but it didn’t seem like she caused trouble for anyone today.</p>

  <p>She even used her Explosion somewhere it wouldn’t cause trouble for the town. The only thing she troubled was a patch of barren ground.</p>

  <p>Yunyun said doing that would cause trouble for others, but she didn’t sound like she meant it, so that doesn’t count.</p>

  <p>After a long day, Megumin finally went home.</p>

  <p>Yunyun looked genuinely lonely as she watched Megumin enter the mansion.</p>

  <p>Bah, screw it. I guess I’ll treat her to dinner.</p>
