  <p>Under the watchful eyes of a bunch of kids, Megumin swept her cloak back and announced herself:</p>

  <p>“My name is Megumin! Axel’s number-one mage—and the one who wields Explosion magic!”</p>

  <p>Standing directly across from her was…</p>

  <p>“My name is Yunyun! The number-one mage of the Crimson Demons… Kyaa! Wait, I’m still introducing myself! Stop, stop!!”</p>

  <p>Yunyun, who started shrieking after getting sucker-punched mid-introduction.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning, at the park in Axel—</p>

  <p>Two Crimson Demons were rolling around on the ground.</p>

  <p>And I was watching the whole thing.</p>

  <p>“…Um. Can we just call that a win for Megumin, for now?”</p>

  <p>“I won’t accept that! There’s a rule that says you wait until your opponent finishes introducing themself… Ah—wait, Megumin! I get it, I get it! I lose, I lose! So stop pulling my hair!!”</p>

  <p>With Megumin still lunging at her like a rabid cat, Yunyun tearfully admitted defeat.</p>

  <p>This whole mess started when Yunyun—who’d come to our mansion for a sleepover—said something offhandedly, with zero bad intentions.</p>

  <p>“It’s true I’ve lost more, but that’s because Megumin always decides what the match is. And it’s not like we’ve ever had a proper, legit match, right?”</p>

  <p>I listened while Megumin and Yunyun bickered about their history. They went on about all sorts of things…</p>

  <p>Like which of them was stronger, and a bunch of other nonsense…</p>

  <p>“Sure, I gave you the title of ‘number-one mage of the Crimson Demons,’ but it still annoys me that you can say it out loud with that much pride!”</p>

  <p>“That’s not a valid reason to break the rules! Geez, fine, I get it, okay!? Round one is my loss, okay!?”</p>

  <p>Megumin pushed Yunyun down and sat on her. No matter how you looked at it, there wasn’t a single trace of maturity here.</p>

  <p>“Since Megumin won round one… the next match is Yunyun’s choice, right?”</p>

  <p>I’d somehow gotten roped into being their “observer,” and I wanted this embarrassing competition to end as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>Thanks to their over-the-top Crimson Demon-style introductions, we’d turned into a minor attraction for the local kids.</p>

  <p>Some of them had even started copying the poses.</p>

  <p>With all those kids watching, Yunyun’s eyes glistened a little as she brushed the dirt off her clothes and picked up the purse she’d dropped during the scuffle.</p>

  <p>“Then the next match will be… this board game!”</p>

  <p>It was a game I recognized—a chess-like board game Megumin was weirdly good at.</p>

  <p>“How pathetic. Yunyun, since you don’t have any friends, did you spend the past year training at this game? I’m sure you’re practically a grandmaster by now.”</p>

  <p>“You don’t have to say the part about me not making any friends out loud! Anyway, what—are you trying to refuse because you know you’ll lose? A true Crimson Demon takes any challenge head-on, right?”</p>

  <p>“You little…”</p>

  <p>Yunyun gave Megumin a fearless smile. Megumin growled through clenched teeth and started setting up the pieces.</p>

  <p>Yunyun won, and the second round ended in spectacularly boring fashion.</p>

  <p>“That makes it one to one! Now then, what should the final match be? A magic showdown like true Crimson Demons? Or, if we’re doing that, we could see who defeats more monsters…”</p>

  <p>Having won round two convincingly, Yunyun was uncharacteristically pumped. Which was probably because she almost never got to do things like this with anyone.</p>

  <p>Then Megumin turned to me.</p>

  <p>“Why don’t we have our observer—Kazuma—choose the final match? I won’t complain about whatever he picks. Now then, let’s finish this!”</p>

  <p>“Kazuma will? Well… I’m fine with that…”</p>

  <p>Even so, I really wanted to hurry up and go home already…</p>

  <p>“Since this is a pain, let’s just settle it with rock-paper—”</p>

  <p>“What do you think this sacred showdown between Crimson Demons is supposed to be!?”</p>

  <p>“Please pick something more seriously!”</p>

  <p>I’d made the only reasonable suggestion possible, and they still tore into me.</p>

  <p>Good grief… Maybe I should suggest a “sexy showdown” where the first one to seduce me wins.</p>

  <p>As I debated whether to say something that would absolutely get me thrown in jail—</p>

  <p>Two patrol officers arrived at the park.</p>

  <p>The kids said something to them, and the officers immediately turned to look our way.</p>

  <p>…I had a bad feeling about this.</p>

  <p>“All right, then. Let’s decide what the match is.”</p>

  <p>The officers seemed to have a bad feeling too, because they didn’t take their eyes off Megumin and Yunyun for a second.</p>

  <p>“What kind of match are we having? By the way, I was thinking I wouldn’t mind spending today in jail…”</p>

  <p>“A-Actually, maybe we can do this some other day, and…”</p>

  <p>Seeing the two of them start to chicken out, the officers hurried over and asked,</p>

  <p>“You two, can we talk for a moment? We got a report from the neighbors about some people teaching kids weird games…”</p>

  <p>“The winner is whoever can stay here the longest! I’m going home first, so—!”</p>

  <p>“I’ll take this challenge head-on! Kuh! As expected of Yunyun, to think you’d defeat me so easily—!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, I didn’t say I accepted that, so I haven’t won yet! And why is Megumin running away like she’s some tragic heroine!? Ah! Um—Officer, please don’t misunderstand! I wasn’t doing anything bad, I—!”</p>

  <p>—Yunyun won.</p>
