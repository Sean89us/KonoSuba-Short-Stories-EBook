  <p>[Originally linked by Natsume from his blog on May 2nd, 2014, this story (and several more!) was never officially published. It might be that he dropped them, or that they didn’t make the cut (or maybe he just wanted to have fun?). In any case, this takes place around volume 4, so the status quo and character relationships are a little different from the later volumes. Thanks to Striker for digging these up.]</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>There was a letter in the mailbox today.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know who it was from, but it was addressed to Darkness.</p>

  <p>In this world, paper was an expensive luxury.</p>

  <p>Receiving a letter written on something that pricey was, apparently, part of the whole “being a noble” package.</p>

  <p>I tried the usual tricks—holding it up to the light, tilting it, squinting at it like that would magically reveal the contents—then gave up and brought it to Darkness.</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, did this world have a tradition of sending New Year’s greetings or anything like that?</p>

  <p>I’d never heard anyone mention Christmas cards, greeting cards… nothing.</p>

  <p>With those thoughts floating around my head, I opened the door to Darkness’s room…</p>

  <p>“Darkness, you’ve got a letter. No return address, but it’s probably from some noble…”</p>

  <p>I froze the instant I stepped inside.</p>

  <p>Darkness—bent over in front of the bed—froze too.</p>

  <p>Her smooth, pale skin was… very visible.</p>

  <p>Her long golden hair spilled forward, draping over her chest and getting in the way—no, gracefully shielding her bare breasts from view.</p>

  <p>And her hands were at her waist, hooked into the waistband of a pair of white panties…</p>

  <p>…Long story short, Darkness was wearing exactly one piece of clothing, and I had walked in at the worst possible moment.</p>

  <p>How did I fall for such a simple trap…?</p>

  <p>Darkness drew in a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Yep. She was about to scream.</p>

  <p>“Mmmph! Mmmph!?”</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands over her chest and made a muffled sound.</p>

  <p>Acting purely on survival instincts, I lunged forward and covered her mouth.</p>

  <p>Darkness gulped.</p>

  <p>It seemed like she couldn’t really do anything right now.</p>

  <p>Which made sense—if she took her hands away from her chest to do anything, I’d get an extremely clear view of her bare breasts.</p>

  <p>Still, the overall situation was… impressive.</p>

  <p>From the waist up, she was completely bare—covering herself with only her hands—and from the waist down she had exactly one last line of defense.</p>

  <p>As if she’d finally processed what position she was in, her cheeks went bright red.</p>

  <p>And not just her face—her shoulders too.</p>

  <p>Tears gathered in her eyes as she looked up at me like she was about to say something…</p>

  <p>No, that’s not what I wanted!</p>

  <p>At least glare at me. Get angry. Do something normal!</p>

  <p>What do I do? How did I even get into this position!?</p>

  <p>Th-thank you very—no, stop that! This is not the time to be grateful!</p>

  <p>Okay. Calm down. Keep a cool head. I can escape this classic “lucky pervert scenario” that shows up in light novels and manga—thank you very much!</p>

  <p>Anyway. Step one: my hand.</p>

  <p>I need to let go…!</p>

  <p>I glanced back at Darkness—teary-eyed, oddly quiet, still trying desperately to cover herself.</p>

  <p>S-she’s not going to scream, right?</p>

  <p>And even if she does… it’s an accident. I didn’t do it on purpose. I have nothing to feel guilty about.</p>

  <p>Oh, right—the letter! I’ll give her the letter!</p>

  <p>If I do that, we can turn this whole incident into something we laugh about later…!</p>

  <p>I reached for the letter that should’ve been in my hand…</p>

  <p>…The letter…?</p>

  <p>“Huh? A letter?”</p>

  <p>Aqua’s voice drifted in from the hallway.</p>

  <p>That unexpected voice made both me and Darkness jump.</p>

  <p>The door was wide open.</p>

  <p>And right in front of it lay the letter I’d dropped.</p>

  <p>Aqua was going to pick it up, check who it was addressed to…</p>

  <p>…And then naturally stroll right into the room.</p>

  <p>I darted my eyes around.</p>

  <p>My gaze landed on the closet.</p>

  <p>I was still covering Darkness’s mouth.</p>

  <p>I grabbed her trembling hand and pulled her toward the closet…!</p>

  <p>“Mmmph! Mmmph!?”</p>

  <p>Her eyes went wide and she made frantic muffled noises, but she followed me without resistance.</p>

  <p>She’s… weirdly cooperative…</p>

  <p>…Ah.</p>

  <p>I suddenly realized what I’d just done.</p>

  <p>Because I’d pulled one of her hands away, she now had only one hand left to cover her chest—and she was desperately trying to keep everything concealed with just that.</p>

  <p>What am I doing!?</p>

  <p>I’ll accept whatever names Aqua wants to call me later. For now, I just needed to survive.</p>

  <p>I loosened my grip on Darkness’s mouth…</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aqua, what are you doing? Why are you turning that letter over and over like that?”</p>

  <p>Megumin’s voice—coming from outside—made my brain short-circuit.</p>

  <p>I panicked and yanked Darkness fully into the closet with me.</p>

  <p>Seriously. What am I doing? What was I thinking?</p>

  <p>“A letter addressed to Darkness? …She’s not in her room. Did she go out?”</p>

  <p>Inside the cramped closet, Darkness—wearing nothing but panties—was pressed awkwardly on top of me.</p>

  <p>“Come to think of it, I haven’t seen Kazuma around either. Maybe they went somewhere together.”</p>

  <p>Aqua’s voice was now inside the room.</p>

  <p>Dammit, quit talking and leave already!</p>

  <p>If you don’t, this is going to get bad. Like, catastrophically bad!</p>

  <p>Right in front of my nose was Darkness, teary-eyed, my hand clamped over her mouth again.</p>

  <p>“Hey, don’t close your eyes! C-come on—why do you give up so quickly in situations like this? Hang in there! And don’t move that hand covering your chest! That would be really bad. I mean, it would look great, but it would still be really bad…!”</p>

  <p>Thank you! Thank you very much!!</p>
