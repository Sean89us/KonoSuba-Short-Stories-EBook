  <p>“Thanks for having me today.”</p>

  <p>“Thank you very much, Dust.”</p>

  <p>I woke up early and dragged myself to the magic item shop, where the beautiful shopkeeper, Wiz, greeted me.</p>

  <p>“U-Um, I really think it’s best not to hire Dust, but…”</p>

  <p>Standing beside Wiz’s gentle smile and saying something that rude was the Loli Succubus—still as flat as ever.</p>

  <p>“Quit saying unnecessary things. This doesn’t have anything to do with you.”</p>

  <p>“True, it might not be my problem, but I have to protect this store while Vanir’s away.”</p>

  <p>Get passionate about whatever you want, but at this point you’re basically just squatting here.</p>

  <p>“It’s fine. Usually nothing much happens here, so there shouldn’t be any problems. And it’s nice to have a guy around to lend a hand.”</p>

  <p>“Good. I needed something easy. I can’t work at the guild for three days, so this really helps me out.”</p>

  <p>“Uugh… I can’t shake the feeling this is a bad idea…”</p>

  <p>“No need to worry. I’m the type of guy who doesn’t do anything unless I’m told, so you can relax.”</p>

  <p>“Um, please do your work properly.”</p>

  <p>I stopped by this shop every now and then and barely ever saw customers, so I figured it’d be fine.</p>

  <p>After hauling a few boxes out of the back room, I was basically done.</p>

  <p>The Loli Succubus handled cleaning and organizing the shelves. With no customers, Wiz simply stood behind the counter, smiling politely at the empty air.</p>

  <p>Once she ran out of things to do up front, the Loli Succubus disappeared into the back room to clean there too.</p>

  <p>Yeah. This really was going to be easy.</p>

  <p>“Good day. Oh, is Vanir not in? I see… so he isn’t.”</p>

  <p>A slightly rotund man entered, then scanned the shop like he owned the place.</p>

  <p>“Welcome. Oh my, thank you again for your help the other day.”</p>

  <p>Wiz came out and gave the man a bow. It seems like he’s an acquaintance of hers.</p>

  <p>“I’ve brought several items with me today.”</p>

  <p>“Er, well… Vanir told me not to buy any more useless products. The staff you sold me the other day—the one that ‘triples the power of any spell’—turned out to be a dud that makes the caster collapse from mana exhaustion after even beginner spells. Vanir got really mad at me for that.”</p>

  <p>Oh. So she actually did remember Vanir’s instructions.</p>

  <p>Seems like she’d learned after buying so many unsellable items and getting charred by his mysterious beams every time.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry. This one definitely isn’t useless. It’ll be a big hit in town, so Vanir will be happy too. I daresay he’ll even apologize for the way he’s treated you.”</p>

  <p>“R-Really. Well, I’ll hear you out, at least.”</p>

  <p>“Hold it! Don’t change your mind that easily! And you—don’t take advantage of Vanir being gone to dump your unsellable junk here. Get out!”</p>

  <p>“W-What is wrong with you? I came in here with a product that’ll definitely make us both rich.”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, it’ll only make you rich.”</p>

  <p>I forcibly dragged the protesting man out of the store.</p>

  <p>So this was how Wiz kept blowing money on useless goods. Vanir really had his work cut out for him.</p>

  <p>“Vanir told you not to buy anything… Where did you even come from?”</p>

  <p>Before I noticed it, Aqua was standing by the counter having a chat with Wiz.</p>

  <p>She must have slipped in while I was dealing with that man.</p>

  <p>“Listen, Wiz! Kazuma told me to stop coming to this store just to hang out!”</p>

  <p>“Why would he do that? I’m more than happy to have you as our guest.”</p>

  <p>“Right? He said some totally incomprehensible stuff like ‘you’re causing trouble for Vanir, so knock it off already.’”</p>

  <p>No, you should understand it.</p>

  <p>You do nothing but cause problems in this store.</p>

  <p>“Ah, right, that’s not why I came. Listen, I’ve got a brilliant money-making idea—”</p>

  <p>“The door is over there. Please go home.”</p>

  <p>“Hey! You’ll receive divine punishment for grabbing a goddess by the neck!”</p>

  <p>“I’ll tell Kazuma you’re causing trouble for Vanir if you keep this up!”</p>

  <p>Aqua put up way more resistance than that merchant earlier, but I eventually got her out the door.</p>

  <p>She stopped resisting the moment she heard Kazuma’s name, so she shouldn’t be a problem for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>Wait, wasn’t this supposed to be an easy job? Why was I already exhausted?</p>

  <p>Does Sir Vanir have to put up with this every day?</p>

  <p>Managing a store sure isn’t easy.</p>

  <p>After that, I fended off a few more “enterprising” merchants trying to dump their wares on us.</p>

  <p>I even managed to unload a few items onto Yunyun when she came by.</p>

  <p>All in all, it was a busy day.</p>

  <p>On the bright side, Vanir was in a great mood when he got back and tossed me a few extra eris on top of what we agreed on.</p>

  <p>With this, I’ll be able to tide things over until I can take on quests again.</p>

  <p>Two days later, I found myself back at the magic item shop.</p>

  <p>“Umm, I ran out of money. So do you think I could work here for—”</p>

  <p>“The door is over there.”</p>
