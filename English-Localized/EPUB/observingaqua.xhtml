  <p>While I was at the adventurers’ guild, looking for easy, profitable quests like I always do, I got a strange, “off the record” request from Kazuma. It seems the guild views him as the caretaker of his party, so they keep making him clean up after their messes.</p>

  <p>He wanted me to investigate what his party gets up to when he’s not around.</p>

  <p>He’s a close friend I owe a lot to, and he even promised a decent reward, so I had no reason to refuse.</p>

  <p>In that case… today, I’ll observe Aqua, the archpriest.</p>

  <p>The next day, I waited in front of Kazuma’s mansion for her to come out, but even by afternoon, nobody seemed interested in leaving.</p>

  <p>“The explosion girl and Lalatina left, but no one else is coming out of the mansion. Kazuma’s inside too. What the hell are they doing? Hey, wait, don’t tell me…”</p>

  <p>When a boy and a girl are alone in a house, it’s obvious what they’ll get up to.</p>

  <p>It’s not like I’m jealous of Kazuma, and it’s not like I want to peep on anything erotic.</p>

  <p>I’ll just take a quick peek to fulfill the request and keep an eye on her for the day.</p>

  <p>I quietly entered the garden and approached a window that looked into the spacious living room with the fireplace.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, the window was cracked open, so I peeked inside through the gap.</p>

  <p>“What’s that?”</p>

  <p>I was greeted by Kazuma’s face poking out from a strange object that looked like a cross between a futon and a desk.</p>

  <p>A blue-haired head could be seen on the other end. That must be Aqua.</p>

  <p>“Come on, scoot over there a little more. It’s too cramped here.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t want to. Just get out. Don’t you prefer sitting in front of the fireplace over huddling under the heated table (kotatsu)?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, but… firewood eventually burns out, and with Megumin and Darkness gone, there’s nobody to replenish it. Oh, Kazuma, why don’t you do it?”</p>

  <p>“No. I’m not leaving the kotatsu! I’d rather spend all day lazing around here than move for you!”</p>

  <p>“You haven’t changed at all! What are you going to do with your life if you’re still a shut-in NEET even after coming to another world? Come on, work hard for the sake of a goddess.”</p>

  <p>“Who are you calling a shut-in NEET!? Anyway, didn’t you say you had an errand to run today? It’s already past noon.”</p>

  <p>“Ah? Why didn’t you say it sooner!? My precious believers are waiting for me!”</p>

  <p>She hurriedly jumped out from under the kotatsu.</p>

  <p>I was planning to head home if they stayed inside all day… Oh well. I followed after Aqua as she left the mansion.</p>

  <p>She was humming a song as she headed out to…</p>

  <p>“Hey, wait, isn’t this the meeting spot for the Axis Cult?”</p>

  <p>Aqua happily walked into the church of the infamous, troublemaking Axis Cult.</p>

  <p>“How’s everyone doing!?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, Aqua! Please, come this way. The tea and snacks will be here momentarily.”</p>

  <p>“What should we do today? How about scribbling ’Eris pads her chest’ on the side of the Eris Church? What do you think?”</p>

  <p>Why were the believers welcoming such a troublesome priest so warmly?</p>

  <p>She’s even leaning back into her chair with a smile.</p>

  <p>They doted on her the way grandparents dote on their grandkids. I know archpriests are respected, but even so… wasn’t this a little much?</p>

  <p>“There might be something deeper going on here… but I don’t really care. I have no interest in understanding how the Axis Cult thinks.”</p>

  <p>After that, they got caught just as they were about to scribble on the wall of the Eris church, and ended up running from both the Eris cultists and the police.</p>

  <p>For a moment, I wondered why I was doing this at all—then I remembered the reward Kazuma promised me and kept following her.</p>

  <p>After parting ways with the Axis cultists, she wandered over to the magic-item shop where Vanir works, to sip tea and pick fights.</p>

  <p>Aqua and Vanir seem to be on terrible terms, but despite the trouble Aqua causes, the shopkeeper still seems happy to have her around.</p>

  <p>Come to think of it, I’d heard Yunyun comes to this shop a lot.</p>

  <p>As the sun began to set, staining the town red, Aqua got up from her seat.</p>

  <p>“It’s already this late. Right, I’ll head back then.”</p>

  <p>“Please come again, Aqua.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t ever come back! It’s because you spoil her that she keeps coming back!”</p>

  <p>Ignoring the curses shouted after her, Aqua hurried back home.</p>

  <p>“I’m home~! What’s for dinner today? I’m starving!”</p>

  <p>After returning home, she called that out to the others and settled into her usual spot at the table.</p>

  <p>There’s no need for me to watch over her any longer.</p>

  <p>The only thing I gleaned from following her around all day was-</p>

  <p>“She’s a girl who simply follows her own desires.”</p>

  <p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
