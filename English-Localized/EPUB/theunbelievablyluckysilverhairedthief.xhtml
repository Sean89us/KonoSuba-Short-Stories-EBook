  <p>“Agh, I lost again! Hey, Chris, how are you so good at cards? Kazuma’s only redeeming quality is his luck, but I think you might be even luckier than him.”</p>

  <p>At the adventurers’ guild, Aqua—who’d been playing cards with Chris—grumbled.</p>

  <p>They were playing something like poker, and Aqua had lost every single game.</p>

  <p>“Isn’t it obvious? It’s because the Chief is—”</p>

  <p>“L-Lowly Assistant?”</p>

  <p>Chris froze, then hurriedly tried to recover.</p>

  <p>“—a thief from the Eris Church.”</p>

  <p>“Ah, right. Eris is the goddess of fortune, so it makes sense her thieves have crazy luck. Yeah, I get it now.”</p>

  <p>Seeing Aqua nod repeatedly, Chris let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Then, Aqua tilted her head to the side and,</p>

  <p>“So between Chris and Kazuma… who actually has higher Luck?”</p>

  <p>She asked a question that threatened my very reason for existing.</p>

  <p>Chris and I exchanged a look…</p>

  <p>“Obviously me. Remember when I ran Aqua’s stall during the Eris Thanksgiving Festival? Not a single customer pulled a winning ticket. Kazuma would have a hard time pulling that off.”</p>

  <p>And she confidently boasted.</p>

  <p>It didn’t look like she had any intention of backing down. Well, she was the goddess of fortune, after all. Still…</p>

  <p>“Hold it. That did happen, but didn’t I successfully Steal your panties? The success rate of Steal depends a lot on Luck. Which means my Luck is higher.”</p>

  <p>“No, hold on, that doesn’t count! Resisting Steal takes magic resistance! I’m a thief—of course I don’t have any!”</p>

  <p>Chris shot back, but I take pride in my luck.</p>

  <p>I pulled out my adventurer card and showed it to Chris.</p>

  <p>“This is my current Luck stat, and it’s still climbing as I level. I’m sure you know what that means.”</p>

  <p>My Luck had gone up a lot since coming to this world. That absurdly high number gleamed on my card.</p>

  <p>“As expected of Kazuma, whose only good stat is Luck. I really wish I could get even one percent of that.”</p>

  <p>“Hey, what do you mean by that? My Intelligence is pretty high too.”</p>

  <p>Aqua ignored my retort and turned to face Chris.</p>

  <p>“So what about yours?”</p>

  <p>Flustered by Aqua’s attention, Chris averted her eyes, clearly debating whether she should pull out her card…</p>

  <p>“Come on, let me see!”</p>

  <p>Aqua snatched Chris’s card out of her pocket…</p>

  <p>“Seriously? Is her Luck stat bugged? I should complain to the guild staff.”</p>

  <p>“N-No, it’s fine! It’s not like it’s causing me any problems…”</p>

  <p>Chris’s Luck stat was so high that Aqua thought the display was bugged. As expected of the goddess of fortune.</p>

  <p>That should’ve settled it, but Aqua said,</p>

  <p>“But this is a problem. There’s no way to tell who has the higher Luck like this.”</p>

  <p>No, we’d already determined who had higher Luck.</p>

  <p>Just when I was about ready to admit defeat, an adventurer sitting at the next table over said,</p>

  <p>“Why don’t you settle it with a game of rock-paper-scissors?”</p>

  <p>Rock-paper-scissors. A game that relies heavily on luck… and, to a small extent, reading your opponent.</p>

  <p>If that was the case, I might actually have a shot.</p>

  <p>“Rock-paper-scissors? Fine by me, but can you really beat me in luck, Lowly Assistant? You haven’t forgotten who I am, have you?”</p>

  <p>“Do you really think I relied on luck alone to beat all those Demon King’s Generals? There’s no way I’d take this challenge without a plan.”</p>

  <p>I clenched my fist and looked at Chris with a serious expression.</p>

  <p>“Oh? Big talk. Come to think of it, didn’t you lose to me in that Steal contest back then? Looking for revenge?”</p>

  <p>Hearing Chris’s words, the surrounding adventurers got excited, and Aqua was looking at us with expectant eyes too.</p>

  <p>“Fine, then. Let’s settle this once and for all! As adventurers, we should act like adventurers and go all out. Rock, paper—!”</p>

  <p>“Huh? Wait, now? Uh, hold on, er—paper!”</p>

  <p>Crap. First round: my loss.</p>

  <p>“Wait, Lowly Assistant, why are you stripping!? There’s no need to strip! I already won!”</p>

  <p>“What are you talking about? We’re adventurers who put our lives on the line. You think we can settle this with the same kind of game kids play? Are you saying I’ve already lost?”</p>

  <p>Hearing my challenge, Chris gritted her teeth.</p>

  <p>“Fine. I accept. There’s no way I can lose!”</p>

  <p>“That’s what I’m talking about! Everyone, back me up!”</p>

  <p>“I’m rooting for you! Blessing!”</p>

  <p>“May Aqua’s blessings be upon you! Blessing!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, get some more priests over here! Aqua, please…”</p>

  <p>“If Kazuma loses, let me go next! I’m a thief too! I’m pretty confident in my luck!”</p>

  <p>“Hey, no fair! Other people shouldn’t be allowed to support you like this! Lowly Assistant, wait!”</p>

  <p>Chris whined after seeing the surrounding adventurers pile buff after buff on me.</p>

  <p>—In the end, every adventurer present—including me—ended up getting stripped bare…</p>
