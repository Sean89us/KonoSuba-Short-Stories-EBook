  <p>Megumin, dressed up, said to me as I lounged on the sofa,</p>

  <p>“…Kazuma, do you want to go on a date with me?”</p>

  <p>“Give me a second. I’ll go change.”</p>

  <p>I answered without thinking and headed for my room, but Megumin stopped me.</p>

  <p>“W-Wait, hold on. I know this is weird coming from me, but… aren’t you going to ask any questions?”</p>

  <p>“What kind of questions?”</p>

  <p>I tilted my head. Megumin looked conflicted and started fidgeting with her fingers.</p>

  <p>“Like… why I’m suddenly asking you on a date, for one.”</p>

  <p>“…? Isn’t it because you’re hitting puberty and started seeing me—the closest guy around—as a potential mate?”</p>

  <p>“Do you take me for a dog or a cat or something!? I don’t think of you like that at all!… S-Sorry, that was a bit much. It’s not like I hate you or anything!”</p>

  <p>Megumin hurriedly corrected herself when she saw me turn away and sulk into my corner of the sofa.</p>

  <p>“…Then what is it? Don’t tell me you lost a bet with Aqua and the others and you’re asking me out as punishment. If so, I’m stripping all of you.”</p>

  <p>“No, that’s not it! The truth is, there’s a reason…”</p>

  <p>Megumin and I walked side by side down the streets of Axel.</p>

  <p>“So, Megumin, the weather’s great today… Perfect for a date, right?”</p>

  <p>“It’s cloudy and windy. Can you talk like a normal person?… Also, don’t hold my hand so tightly. Your palm is all sweaty…”</p>

  <p>On top of that, we were holding hands like a real couple.</p>

  <p>Even if it’s “just Megumin,” I was still nervous as hell.</p>

  <p>“I can’t help it! It’s my first date! The last time I held a girl’s hand was back in grade school! Even if it’s you, I’m still going to be nervous!”</p>

  <p>“’Even if it’s you’? What’s that supposed to mean!? How rude can you be!? And you’re too loud! What if he hears you?! Also, what’s ’grade school’?”</p>

  <p>As she scolded me under her breath, Megumin took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the sweat from my palm.</p>

  <p>“If holding hands makes you nervous, this should help.”</p>

  <p>With that, she deliberately hooked her arm around mine as if to show off to everyone.</p>

  <p>Once I’d calmed down a little, I started discreetly scanning our surroundings.</p>

  <p>“So, is he following us?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah. Right now he’s hiding behind the butcher’s sign and watching us.”</p>

  <p>I glanced back and saw a boy a little younger than Megumin peeking at us from behind the butcher’s sign.</p>

  <p>“I didn’t expect there to be a creep weird enough to stalk you…”</p>

  <p>“Hey, what do you mean by ’creep’? Explain.”</p>

  <p>That was why she’d suddenly asked me out.</p>

  <p>That boy had been following her around nonstop for a while, so she wanted me to pretend to be her boyfriend and make him give up. A classic cliché.</p>

  <p>Megumin looked pretty good as long as she kept her mouth shut, so I guess it wasn’t that strange.</p>

  <p>“All right, I’ll do my best to act lovey-dovey.”</p>

  <p>“We’re just pretending! Y-You know that, right? Don’t take it too far!”</p>

  <p>And thus, my date with Megumin began.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>“Idiot. Sharing a single drink is a couples’ staple, isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>“I know, I know! But normally you’d use two straws, not drink straight from it… Hey! You drank it all! How could you!? I bought that!”</p>

  <p>First, we argued over the correct way to share a drink.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>“You could probably get in with a kid’s ticket, so let’s use what we save to buy popcorn.”</p>

  <p>“Wait, that might be true, but I feel like a vital part of me would die if I did that… Ah! Look, Kazuma, look! Let’s watch this play! ’Putamkin Punches Through All Troubles’! Strife, civil war, corruption, famine—watch the legendary nobleman Putamkin punch his way through it all! A jolly martial-arts play starring Baron Putamkin!”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, I was curious too, but that’s not exactly date material…”</p>

  <p>Then we agonized over which show to see.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>“I really didn’t expect Baron Putamkin to break the heirloom vase he risked his life to retrieve!”</p>

  <p>“Yeah! And I definitely didn’t expect the princess to get punched right as she was saying her brothers would have no reason to fight over the vase anymore!”</p>

  <p>“I didn’t expect the princess to be the mastermind! At first, I thought the protagonist was a lunatic who just punches anyone he sees!”</p>

  <p>“They say historians are still studying Baron Putamkin! Some people think he just punches on instinct without thinking or investigating, but most historians agree there’s no way anyone could be that crazy…”</p>

  <p>Finally, we enthusiastically discussed what we’d just watched.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>“The baron said, ’Meat is justice!‘ So we should follow his words and go get some meat!”</p>

  <p>“Not today—we should eat eel! It’s Redemption Day, the day the baron defeated the Eight-Headed Eel with his fists, used its meat to end the famine, and used the bounty to solve the country’s financial problems!”</p>

  <p>“Then let’s settle it with rock-paper-scissors.”</p>

  <p>“There’s no way I can beat you at rock-paper-scissors! We’re on a date, so you should listen to the girl sometimes!”</p>

  <p>“Going on a date just to make the guy buy you expensive eel… you’re abusing the power of being a woman!”</p>

  <p>All the way to the end, there wasn’t a hint of romance on this date.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>“-So, is he still following us?”</p>

  <p>“I can’t see him, but we didn’t do anything especially couple-y…”</p>

  <p>We said as we headed back after the date.</p>

  <p>The boy who’d been following us had vanished somewhere along the way.</p>

  <p>Maybe we looked like a loving couple from the outside…</p>

  <p>“Anyway, let’s head back. Even if he’s still following us, he’ll give up once he sees us going back to the same mansion.”</p>

  <p>Hearing my words, Megumin said,</p>

  <p>“The date isn’t over yet.”</p>

  <p>And with a bright smile, she took my hand.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>On the way to the town gate.</p>

  <p>“…Seriously? Ending our date with an Explosion trip? That’s not romantic at all.”</p>

  <p>“So what? This is what a date between us is supposed to be like. I had a lot of fun today.”</p>

  <p>Saying that, Megumin suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p>

  <p>…That boy was waiting right in front of the gate.</p>

  <p>If he’s appeared right in front of us, he must have resolved himself to take some kind of action.</p>

  <p>I stepped in front of Megumin, and the boy approached with a hesitant expression.</p>

  <p>“Instructor Megumin, please… Please teach me Explosion magic!”</p>

  <p>….</p>

  <p>“Eh?”</p>

  <p>Megumin and I blurted out in unison.</p>

  <p>“Huh? What’s going on? You’re the one who’s been following Megumin around, right? Wasn’t that because you were in love with her?”</p>

  <p>“Huh? Don’t joke around. I like older women, you know? I have the right to choose who I fall for. I was following Instructor Megumin around because I was captivated by the splendor of Explosion, that’s all.”</p>

  <p>He looked younger than Megumin to me, but apparently he thought she was the younger one.</p>

  <p>I laughed along with him.</p>

  <p>“Yeah, of course. Isn’t this great, Megumin? You’ve got a disciple now. I thought it was weird for someone to stalk you—there’s a limit to how messed up a person’s tastes can be…”</p>

  <p>As soon as I said that, I noticed the boy’s face going paler by the second.</p>

  <p>At the same time, my Enemy Detection skill went off.</p>

  <p>No mistake about it—there was a bloodthirsty monster standing right behind me.</p>

  <p>“Listen. Don’t make any sudden moves—just back away slowly. And if you hear it, don’t even look. Run.”</p>

  <p>The pale-faced boy nodded shakily.</p>

  <p>Every instinct I had was screaming at me not to look back.</p>

  <p>When I heard a chant I was far too familiar with behind me, we both bolted at the same instant—</p>
